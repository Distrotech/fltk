Documentaion is being migrated to the Doxygen program, which generated
API documentation directly from comments in the source code. Doxygen
is run from files in the ../doc directory. However the old html files
in this directory are being copied over to the Doxygen files now. When
this is done these old files will be deleted.

.......

The documentation in this directory is in HTML format.  To read it just
point your browser at the "index.html" file. A slightly more browseable
version is accessable at the FLTK web site, along with PostScript(tm)
and PDF versions of the manual.

You can generate your own (printable) copy of the manual by typing
"make" in this directory.  You will need to have the HTMLDOC software
installed on your system.  HTMLDOC can be downloaded from:

    http://www.easysw.com/htmldoc

The default media size is 8.27x11.0" (210x279mm), which is the lesser
of A4 and US Letter sizes.  You can change this in the makefile by
uncommenting the corresponding media size or defining your own.

If you find any typos, things that are unclear, or would like to
contribute an example, section, or chapter to the FLTK manual, please
contact Michael Sweet (mike@easysw.com).
