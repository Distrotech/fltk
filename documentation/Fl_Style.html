<h2>struct Fl_Style</h2>
<hr>

<p>Each widget has a pointer to an instance of Fl_Style.  Usually many
widgets share pointers to the same Fl_Style.  All the Fl_Styles are
linked into a hierarchy of parents & child styles, so that it is
possible to change an item in a parent style and propagate all the
changes to the children.

<p>When a widget looks up a value from a style, it looks at that style
and each parent up until it finds a non-zero value to return, or until
there are no more parents, in which case zero is used.  Thus changing
a parent style can make global changes as long as widgets do not have
local values set.

<p>In normal usage "set" methods like Fl_Widget::box(n) will create a
"unique" style for that widget, which is a child of the original
style, and set the box in that style.  This "unique" style is reused
for any other changes to that widget and it is deleted when the widget
is deleted.

<h3>Member variables</h3>

<a name=box><h4><a href=Fl_Boxtype.html>Fl_Boxtype</a> box;</h4>

The type of box to draw around the outer edge of the widget (for the
majority of widgets, some classes ignore this or use it to draw only
text fields inside the widget). The default is <code>FL_DOWN_BOX</code>.

<a name=button_box><h4><a href=Fl_Boxtype.html>Fl_Boxtype</a> button_box;</h4>

The type of box to draw buttons internal the widget (notice that <a
href="Fl_Button.html">Fl_Button</a> uses <tt>box</tt>, however). The
default is <code>FL_UP_BOX</code>.

<a name=focus_box><h4><a href=Fl_Boxtype.html>Fl_Boxtype</a> focus_box;</h4>

Type of box to draw to indicate focus. This is always called with the
<tt>FL_INVISIBLE</tt> flag as only the border should be drawn. The
default is <tt>FL_DOTTED_FRAME</tt>.

<a name=glyph><h4>void (*glyph)(const <a href="Fl_Widget.html">Fl_Widget</a>*, int glyph, int x, int y, int w, int h, Fl_Flags);</h4>

Draw part of a widget, called a "glyph". Examples are the up and down
arrows on sliders, the slider itself, and check boxes. The base class
draws arrow buttons (because they are so commonly used), but most
widgets that use this define their own function to call. A theme can
make these functions point at it's own code and thus customize the
appearance of widgets quite a bit.

<p>The default glyph function can draw these values for <i>glyph</i>:

<p><ul>

<li>Zero is reserved to draw an empty box
<li><code>FL_GLYPH_UP</code> - draw an up arrow
<li><code>FL_GLYPH_UP_BUTTON</code> - draw an up arrow in a box
<li><code>FL_GLYPH_DOWN</code> - draw a down arrow
<li><code>FL_GLYPH_DOWN_BUTTON</code> - draw a down arrow in a box
<li><code>FL_GLYPH_LEFT</code> - draw a left arrow
<li><code>FL_GLYPH_LEFT_BUTTON</code> - draw a left arrow in a box
<li><code>FL_GLYPH_RIGHT</code> - draw a right arrow
<li><code>FL_GLYPH_RIGHT_BUTTON</code> - draw a right arrow in a box
scrollbar
<li>All other values draw an empty box.

</ul>

<p>If you wish to write your own glyph function you should examine the
ones in the fltk source code and in the sample theme plugins to see
how the arguments are interpreted.

<a name=label_font><h4><a href=Fl_Font.html>Fl_Font</a> label_font;</h4>

The font used to draw the label.  Default is <code>FL_HELVETICA</code>.

<a name=label_size><h4>unsigned int label_size;</h4>

Size of <code>label_font</code>.  Default is 12.

<a name=text_font><h4><a href=Fl_Font.html>Fl_Font</a> text_font;</h4>

Provides a font for text displays.  Default is <code>FL_HELVETICA</code>.

<a name=text_size><h4>unsigned int text_size;</h4>

Size of <code>text_font</code>.  Checkboxes and some other widgets use
this to control the size of the glyph. Default is 12.

<a name=leading><h4>unsigned int leading;</h4>

Extra spacing added between text lines or other things that are
stacked vertically.  The default is 0 (menus have a default of 4).

<a name=label_type><h4><a href=Fl_Labeltype.html>Fl_Labeltype</a> label_type;</h4>

How to draw the label.  This provides things like inset, shadow, and
the symbols.  <code>FL_NORMAL_LABEL</code>.

<a name=color><h4><a href=Fl_Color.html>Fl_Color</a> color;</h4>

Color of the widgets. The default is <code>FL_WHITE</code>. This color
is inherited by text displays and browsers, most of the "gray" you see
is due to widgets like Fl_Group that default the color to gray, and
the fact that many parts of the interface are drawn with the
button_color described below.

<p>If you want to change the overall color of all the gray parts of
the interface you want to call <a
href="Fl_Color.html#fl_background"><tt>fl_background(color)</tt></a>
instead, as this will set the entry for <code>FL_GRAY</code> and also
set the "gray ramp" so that the edges of buttons are the same color.

<a name=label_color><h4><a href=Fl_Color.html>Fl_Color</a> label_color;</h4>

Color used to draw labels and glyphs.  Default is <code>FL_BLACK</code>.

<a name=highlight_color><h4><a href=Fl_Color.html>Fl_Color</a> highlight_color;</h4>

The color to draw the widget when the mouse is over it (for scrollbars
and sliders this is used to color the buttons).  The default of
zero disables highlighting.

<a name=highlight_label_color><h4><a href=Fl_Color.html>Fl_Color</a> highlight_label_color;</h4>

Color to draw labels atop the <code>highlight_color</code>.  The
default of zero leaves the <code>label_color</code> unchanged.

<a name=button_color><h4><a href=Fl_Color.html>Fl_Color</a> button_color;</h4>

Color used when drawing internal buttons. Default is <code>FL_GRAY</code>.
Check and radio buttons use this to color in the glyph.

<a name=text_color><h4><a href=Fl_Color.html>Fl_Color</a> text_color;</h4>

Color to draw text inside the widget.  Default is black. Check and
radio buttons use this to control the color of the checkmark.

<a name=selection_color><h4><a href=Fl_Color.html>Fl_Color</a> selection_color;</h4>

Color drawn behind selected text in inputs, or selected browser or
menu items, or lit light buttons.  The default is Windows 95 blue.

<a name=selection_text_color><h4><a href=Fl_Color.html>Fl_Color</a> selection_text_color;</h4>

The color to draw text atop the <code>selection_color</code>.  The
default is <code>FL_WHITE</code>.

<a name=find><h4><a href="Fl_Named_Style.html">Fl_Named_Style</a>* Fl_Style::find(const char* name);</h4>

<p>This is a <i>static</i> method on Fl_Style. It returns the first
style found that matches the name.  Case is ignored and spaces and
underscores are considered equivalent. If nothing matches
<tt>NULL</tt> is returned.

<p>Theme-setting code uses this to locate the styles it has to
modify. Using a string to locate the styles serves several
purposes:

<ul>

<li>It allows a theme plugin to locate and modify styles that are in
your program as well as in the fltk library.

<li>It allows a theme plugin to read a text database and not have to
implement a translation from names to styles.

<li>If you static-link your fltk program and include a theme function,
it won't link in all the classes that you are not using but it tries
to modify.

<li>On machines that allow a plugin to be loaded into a static-linked
program (some Unix systems, Linux if you use -shared) it means the
plugin can work even if it wants to modify some fltk classes that were
not linked in.

</ul>
