<h1 ALIGN=RIGHT><A NAME=intro>1 - Introduction to FLTK</A></h1>

The Fast Light Tool Kit (&quot;FLTK&quot;, pronounced &quot;fulltick&quot;) is a LGPL'd 
C++ graphical user interface toolkit for X (UNIX&reg;), OpenGL&reg;, and 
Microsoft&reg; Windows&reg; NT 4.0, 95, or 98. It was originally developed by 
Mr. Bill Spitzak and is currently maintained by a small group of 
developers across the world with a central repository in the US. 

<h2>Features</h2>

FLTK was designed to be statically linked. This was done by splitting 
it into many small objects and desigining it so that functions that are 
not used do not have pointers to them in the parts that are used, and 
thus do not get linked in. This allows you to make an easy-to-install 
program, or to modify FLTK to the exact requirements of your 
application, without worrying about bloat. FLTK works fine as a shared 
library, though, and has started being included on Linux distributions. 

<P>Here are some of the core features unique to FLTK: </P>

<UL>
<LI>sizeof(Fl_Widget) == 60.</LI>
<LI>The &quot;core&quot; (the &quot;hello&quot; program compiled &amp; linked with a static 
FLTK  library using gcc on a 486 and then stripped) is 82K.</LI>
<LI>The FLUID program (which includes every widget) is 352k.
<LI>Written directly atop Xlib (or WIN32) for maximum speed,  and 
carefully optimized for code size and performance.</LI>
<LI>Precise low-level compatability between the X11 and WIN32  version 
(only about 10% of the code is different).</LI>
<LI>Interactive user interface builder program. Output is 
 human-readable and editable C++ source code.</LI>
<LI>Support for X11 overlay hardware (emulation if none and under
WIN32.)</LI>
<LI>Very small &amp; fast portable 2-D drawing library with PostScript
style functions, to hide  Xlib and WIN32.</LI>
<LI>OpenGL/Mesa drawing area widget.</LI>
<LI>Support for OpenGL overlay hardware on both X11 and WIN32. 
Emulation if none.</LI>
<LI>Text input fields with Emacs key bindings, X cut &amp; paste, and 
foreign letter compose!</LI>
<LI>Compatibility header file for the GLUT library.</LI>
<LI>Compatibility header file for the XForms library.</LI>
<LI>Much too much to list here...</LI>
</UL>

<h2>Licensing</h2>

FLTK comes with complete free source code. FLTK is available under the 
terms of the <A href=license.html>GNU Library General Public License</A>. 
You can use it in commercial software!

<p>Permission is <i>explicitly granted</i> to distribute programs
without source code that are <i>statically linked</i> with FLTK. There
is controversy over whether the LGPL allows static as opposed to
dynamic (DLL or shared) linking. I believe static linking is allowed
under section 6b, provided you offer to provide object files (an offer
that you can make sufficiently difficult that nobody will follow
it). If in fact the LGPL does not allow static linking we will
immediately distribute FLTK under a new license that allows it.

<H2>What Does &quot;FLTK&quot; Mean?</H2>

FLTK was originally designed to be compatible with the Forms Library
written for SGI machines. In that library all the functions and
structures started with &quot;fl_&quot;. This naming was extended to
all new methods and widgets in the C++ library, and this prefix was
taken as the name of the library. It is almost impossible to search
for &quot;FL&quot; on the Internet, due to the fact that it is also
the abbreviation for Florida. After much debating and searching for a
new name for the toolkit, which was already in use by several people,
Bill came up with &quot;FLTK&quot;, and even a bogus excuse that it
stands for &quot;The Fast Light Tool Kit&quot;.

<h2>History of FLTK</h2>

It has always been Bill's belief that the "operating system" does not
have to provide <i>any</i> of what people call "GUI".  Toolkits (even
FLTK) are <I>not</I> what should be provided, the system only has to
provide arbitrary shaped but featureless windows, a <i>powerful</i>
set of graphics drawing calls, and a <i>simple, unalterable</i> method
of delivering events to the owners of the windows. Much of the design
of FLTK is to prove that complex UI ideas could be entirely
implemented in a user space toolkit, with no knowledge or support by
the system.

<P>Many of the ideas in FLTK were developed on a NeXT (but <I>not</I>
using NextStep) in 1987 in a C toolkit Bill called
&quot;viewkit&quot;.  Here he came up with passing events downward in
the tree and having the handle routine return a value indicating they
used the event, which got rid of the need for "interests" that so
complicated Motif and NeWS.

<P>After going to film school for a few years, Bill worked at Sun
Microsystems on the (doomed) NeWS project.  Here he found an even
better and cleaner windowing system, and he reimplemented
&quot;viewkit&quot; atop that.  NeWS did have an unnecessarily complex
method of delivering events which hurt it.  But the designers did
admit that perhaps the user could write just as good of a button as
they could, and officially exposed the lower level interface.

<P>With the death of NeWS Bill realized that he would have to live
with X. The biggest problem with X is the &quot;window manager&quot;,
which means that the toolkit can no longer control the window borders
or drag the window around. Indeed far more code is spent trying to
talk to window managers than would be needed to draw the borders
themselves. (fortunately the problems with X are also replicated on
Windows, and thus solving them helped with the porting to Windows).

<P>At Digital Domain Bill discovered another toolkit,
&quot;Forms&quot;.  Forms was similar to his work, but provided many
more widgets, since it was used in many real applications, rather then
as theoretical work. Several large pieces of software were written
using a version of Forms with the menus and file browser replaced with
code from viewkit.

<P>The need to switch to OpenGL, a desire to use C++, and the
closed-source nature of XForms, all led to a rquirement to rewrite
Forms.  This produced the first version of FLTK.  The conversion to
C++ required so many changes it made it impossible to recompile any
Forms objects.  Since it was incompatible anyway, Bill decided to
incorporate his older ideas as much as possible.

<P>Bill received permission to release it for free on the Internet, 
with the GNU general public license.  Response from Internet users 
indicated that the Linux market dwarfed the SGI and high-speed GL 
market, so he rewrote it to use X for all drawing, greatly speeding it 
up on these machines.  That is the version you have now.

<P>Digital Domain has since withdrawn support for FLTK.  While Bill is 
no longer able to actively develop it, he still contributes to FLTK in 
his free time and is a part of the FLTK development team.

<h2>Building and Installing FLTK Under UNIX</h2>

In most cases you can just type &quot;make&quot;.  This will run configure with 
the default of no options and then compile everything. 
<P>FLTK uses GNU autoconf to configure itself for your UNIX platform. 
The main things that the configure script will look for are the X11 and
OpenGL (or Mesa) header and library files.  If these cannot be
found in the standard include/library locations you'll need to define the
<tt>CFLAGS</tt>, <tt>CXXFLAGS</tt>, and <tt>LDFLAGS</tt> environment
variables. For the Bourne and Korn shells you'd use:</P>

<UL><PRE>
CFLAGS=-I<I>includedir</I>; export CFLAGS
CXXFLAGS=-I<I>includedir</I>; export CXXFLAGS
LDFLAGS=-L<I>libdir</I>; export LDFLAGS
</PRE></UL>

For C shell and tcsh, use:

<UL><PRE>
setenv CFLAGS "-I<I>includedir</I>"
setenv CXXFLAGS "-I<I>includedir</I>"
setenv LDFLAGS "-L<I>libdir</I>"
</PRE></UL>

By default configure will look for a C++ compiler named <tt>CC</tt>, <tt>c++</tt>,
<tt>g++</tt>, or <tt>gcc</tt> in that order. To use another compiler you need
to set the <tt>CXX</tt> environment variable:

<UL><PRE>
CXX=xlC; export xlC
setenv CXX "xlC"
</PRE></UL>

The <tt>CC</tt> environment variable can also be used to override the
default C compiler (<tt>cc</tt> or <tt>gcc</tt>), which is used for a
few FLTK source files.

<P>You can run configure yourself to get the exact setup you need. Type 
&quot;./configure &lt;options&gt;&quot;, where options are: </P>

<DL>
<DT>--enable-debug</DT>
<DD>Enable debugging code &amp; symbols</DD>
<DT>--enable-shared</DT>
<DD>Enable generation of shared libraries</DD>
<DT>--bindir=/path</DT>
<DD>Set the location for executables [default = /usr/local/bin]</DD>
<DT>--libdir=/path</DT>
<DD>Set the location for libraries [default = /usr/local/lib]</DD>
<DT>--includedir=/path</DT>
<DD>Set the location for include files. [default = /usr/local/include]</DD>
<DT>--prefix=/dir</DT>
<DD>Set the directory prefix for files [default = /usr/local]</DD>
</DL>

When the configure script is done you can just run the &quot;make&quot; command. 
This will build the library, FLUID tool, and all of the test programs. 
<P>To install the library, become root and type &quot;make install&quot;.  This 
will copy the &quot;fluid&quot; executable to &quot;bindir&quot;, the header files to 
&quot;includedir&quot;, and the library files to &quot;libdir&quot;. </P>

<h2>Building FLTK Under Microsoft Windows</h2>

There are two ways to build FLTK under Microsoft Windows.  The first
is to use the Visual C++ 5.0 project files under the
&quot;visualc&quot; directory.  Just open (or double-click on) the
&quot;fltk.dsw&quot; file to get the whole shebang.

<P>The second method is to use a GNU-based development tool with the
files in the &quot;makefiles&quot; directory.  To build using one of
these tools simply copy the appropriate makeinclude and config files
to the main directory and do a make: </P>

<UL><PRE>
copy makefiles\Makefile.&lt;env&gt; Makefile
make
</PRE></UL>

<H3>Using the Visual C++ DLL Library</H3>

The &quot;fltkdll.dsp&quot; project file builds a DLL-version of the FLTK
library. Because of name mangling differences between PC compilers (even
between different versions of Visual C++!) you can only use the DLL that
is generated with the same version compiler that you built it with.

<P>When compiling an application or DLL that uses the FLTK DLL, you will need
to define the <tt>FL_SHARED</tt> preprocessor symbol to get the correct linkage
commands embedded within the FLTK header files.

<h2>Building FLTK Under OS/2</h2>

The current OS/2 build requires XFree86 for OS/2 to work.  A native 
Presentation Manager version has not been implemented yet (volunteers 
are welcome!). 

<p>The current set of Makefiles/configuration files assumes that EMX
0.9d and libExt (from <A
HREF="http://posix2.sourceforge.net">posix2.sourceforge.net</A>) is
installed.

<P>To build the XFree86 version of FLTK for OS/2, copy the appropriate 
makeinclude and config files to the main directory and do a make: </P>

<UL><PRE>
copy makefiles\Makefile.os2x Makefile
make
</PRE></UL>
