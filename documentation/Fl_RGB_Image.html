<h2>class Fl_RGB_Image</h2>
<hr>

This subclass of <a href="Fl_Image.html"><tt>Fl_Image</tt></a>
encapsulates a full-color RGB image, and allows you to 
make an <TT>Fl_Widget</TT> use an image as a label, or to just draw the 
image directly.

<H4>Fl_RGB_Image(const uchar *data, int W, int H, int D = 3, int LD = 0)</H4>
 Construct using a pointer to RGB data. <TT>W</TT> and <TT>H</TT> are 
the size of the image in pixels. <TT>D</TT> is the delta between pixels 
(it may be more than 3 to skip alpha or other data, or negative to flip 
the image left/right). <TT>LD</TT> is the delta between lines (it may 
be more than <TT>D * W</TT> to crop images, or negative to flip the 
image vertically).  The data pointer is simply copied to the object, so 
it must point at persistent storage. 
<H4>~Fl_RGB_Image()</H4>
 The destructor will destroy any X pixmap created.  It does not do 
anything to the data. 
<H4>void draw(int x, int y, int w, int h, int ox = 0, int oy = 0)</H4>
The image is clipped to the destination rectangle: the area
<TT>ox,oy,w,h</TT> is copied to <TT>x,y,w,h</TT>.
<H4>void draw(int x, int y)</H4>
 Draws the image with the upper-left corner at <TT>x,y</TT>.  This is 
the same as doing <TT>draw(x,y,this-&gt;w,this-&gt;h,0,0)</TT>.
