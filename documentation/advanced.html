<P>This chapter explains advanced programming and design topics
that will help you to get the most out of FLTK.</P>

<H2><A NAME="multithreading">10.1 Multithreading</H2>

<P>FLTK supports multithreaded application using a locking mechanism
based on "pthreads". We do not provide a threading interface 
as part of the library. However a simple example how threads can 
be implemented for all supported platforms can be found in 
<tt>test/threads.h</tt> and <tt>test/threads.cxx</tt>.

<P>To use the locking mechanism, the command line version of FLTK
must be compiled with <tt>--enable-threads</tt> set during the 
<tt>configure</tt> process. IDE-based versions of FLTK are 
automatically compiled with locking enabled if possible.

<P>In <TT>main()</TT>, before calling <TT>Fl::run()</TT>, call 
<TT>Fl::lock()</TT>. This will startup the runtime multithreading 
support for your program. All callbacks and derived functions 
like <tt>handle()</tt> and <tt>draw()</tt> will now be properly
locked.

<pre>
  main() {
    <a href="Fl.html#Fl.lock">Fl::lock()</a>;
    /* run thread */
    while(Fl::wait() > 0) {
      if(<a href="Fl.html#Fl.thread_message">Fl::thread_message()</a>) {
        /* process your data */
      }
    }
  }

</pre>

<P>You can now start as many threads as you like. From within
a thread (other than the main thread) FLTK calls must be wrapped
in the following code:

<pre>
  <a href="Fl.html#Fl.lock">Fl::lock()</a>;      // avoid conflicting calls
  ...              // your code here
  <a href="Fl.html#Fl.unlock">Fl::unlock()</a>;    // allow other threads to access FLTK again
  <a href="Fl.html#Fl.awake">Fl::awake(msg)</a>;  // tells FLTK that another thread has made changes

</pre>

<P>FLTK supports multiple platforms, some of them which do not 
allow any other but the main thread to handle system events and
open or close windows. The safe thing to do is to adhere to the 
following rulesi for threads on all operating systems.

<ul>

<li>don't <tt>show()</tt> or <tt>hide()</tt>anything that contains 
widgets derived from <tt>Fl_Window</tt>, including dialogs, file
choosers, subwindows or <tt>Fl_GL_Window</tt>s</li>

<li>don't call <tt>Fl::wait()</tt>, <tt>Fl::flush()</tt> or any 
related methods that will handle system messages</li>

<li>don't start or cancel timers</li>

<li>don't change window decorations or titles</li>

<li><tt>make_current()</tt> may or may not work well for regular
windows, but should always work for <tt>Fl_GL_Window</tt>s to 
allow for high speed rendering on graphics cards with multiple 
pipelines</li>

</ul>
