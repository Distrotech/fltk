<h2>class fltk::Image</h2>
<hr>

This class holds an image, normally used to label a widget.  The
subclasses define how the data is interpreted, and usually store
server-side cached versions of the image.  All the current types
define pixel arrays, but other types of images, such as vector
graphics, can be defined.

<h3>Methods</h3>

<h4>void* id, mask;
<br>int w,h;
<br>void _draw(int x, int y, fltk::Flags flags)</h4>

Subclasses that draw a fixed-size and unchanging image can use these
protected methods that use system-specific code to cache images in a
form that is ready to be drawn on the screen quickly. In the first
call to <tt>draw()</tt> they can set <tt>w</tt> and <tt>h</tt> to the
size of the image, <tt>id</tt> and <tt>mask</tt> to the color and
transparency offscreen windows, using system-specific code.  Then they
can call <tt>_draw()</tt> to draw them, and all subsequent calls they
can just call <tt>_draw()</tt>. To test if this is the first call to
<tt>draw()</tt> a subclass can check if <tt>id</tt> is zero.

<h4><a name=measure>virtual void fltk::Image::measure(int& w, int& h);</a></h4>

The two parameters are set to the size the image will occupy when
drawn. For image types that can scale these are also input parameters:
they must be preset to the rectangle the caller intends to pass to
<tt>draw()</tt>. This is for scaling and tiling image types. To find
the "natural" size of a scaling image, preset w and h to zero before
calling this.

<h4><a name=draw>virtual void fltk::Image::draw(int x,int y,int w,int h, fltk::Flags);</a></h4>

Draw the image with the upper-left corner at <i>x,y</i>. If the image
can scale or tile or otherwise uses a size, the <i>w,h</i> describe
the size of the box it is wanted to fill. The <i>flags</i> can be used
by subclasses to draw differently if <tt>fltk::INACTIVE</tt> or any other
flags are set.

<h4>virtual fltk::Image::~Image();</h4>

The destructor throws away temporary data created to draw the image,
but in most cases does not destroy the local data passed to a
constructor.

<h4>void draw(int x, int y, fltk::Flags = 0)</h4>

Draws the image with the upper-left corner at <tt>x,y</tt>.  This is 
the same as doing <tt>draw(x, y, this-&gt;w, this-&gt;h, flags)</tt>.

<p>The base class destructor will destroy anything created for <tt>id</tt> or
<tt>mask</tt>.
