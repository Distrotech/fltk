<a name=basics><h1>FLTK Basics</h1>

This chapter will show you how to write and compile a very simple FLTK
program.

<a name=sample><h2>A sample FLTK program</h2>

<pre>
#include &lt;fltk/Fl.h&gt;
#include &lt;fltk/Fl_Window.h&gt;
#include &lt;fltk/Fl_Box.h&gt;

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  Fl_Window *window = new Fl_Window(300,180);
  Fl_Box *box = new Fl_Box(20,40,260,100,"Hello, World!");
  box->box(FL_UP_BOX);
  box->label_font(FL_HELVETICA_BOLD_ITALIC);
  box->label_size(36);
  box->label_type(FL_SHADOW_LABEL);
  window->end();
  window->show(argc, argv);
  return Fl::run();
}
</pre>

The resulting program will display the window below. You can quit the 
program by closing the window or pressing the ESCape key.

<h3>Header Files</h3>

The proper way to include FLTK header files is: 

<pre>
#include &lt;fltk/Fl_xyz.h&gt;
</pre>

<p>All programs must include the file <TT>&lt;fltk/Fl.h&gt;</TT>. In
addition the program must include a header file for each FLTK class it
uses. This sample program uses <a href=Fl_Window.html>Fl_Window</a>
and <a href=Fl_Box.html>Fl_Box</a>.

<p>Programs that call FLTK <a href=drawing.html>drawing functions</a>
must include <tt>&lt;fltk/fl_draw.h&gt;</tt>

<h3>Creating the Widgets</h3>

<p>After including the required header files, the program then creates a 
window: 

<pre>
Fl_Window *window = new <A href=Fl_Window.html#Fl_Window>Fl_Window</A>(300,180);
</pre>

It then creates a box with the "Hello, World!" string in it, this new
widget is made a "child" of the window we just created:

<pre>
Fl_Box *box = new <A href=Fl_Box.html#Fl_Box>Fl_Box</A>(20,40,260,100,"Hello, World!");
</pre>

<p>For most widgets the arguments to the constructor are:

<pre>
Fl_Widget(x, y, width, height, label)
</pre>

<P><i>x</i> and <i>y</i> are the location of the upper-left corner of
the widget, measured in pixels. For windows this is measured from the
upper-left corner of the screen, for widgets it is measured from the
upper-left corner of the window.

<p><i>width</i> and <i>height</i> are the size of the widget. 

<p><i>label</i> is a pointer to a character string to label the
widget with or <tt>NULL</tt>. If not given it defaults to
<tt>NULL</tt>. The string is not copied, FLTK assummes it resides in
static storage. This is true of almost all interfaces in FLTK that
take string constants, and greatly speeds up FLTK. (see <a
href=Fl_Widget.html#copy_label>Fl_Widget::copy_label()</a> for a
method that has more traditional behavior).

<h3>Get/Set Methods</h3>

Next we set several "attributes" of the box:

<pre>
box-&gt;box(FL_UP_BOX);
box-&gt;<A href=Fl_Widget.html#label_font>label_font</A>(FL_HELVETICA_BOLD_ITALIC);
box-&gt;<A href=Fl_Widget.html#label_size>label_size</A>(36);
box-&gt;<A href=Fl_Widget.html#label_type>label_type</A>(FL_SHADOW_LABEL);
</pre>

<tt>box-&gt;box(FL_UP_BOX)</tt> sets the type of box the Fl_Box draws,
changing it from the default of <tt>FL_NO_BOX</tt>, which means that
no box is drawn. In our "Hello, World!" example we use <TT>
FL_UP_BOX</TT>, which means that a raised button border will be drawn
around the widget.  You can see the available boxtypes in <A
href=common.html#boxtypes> Chapter 3</A>

<p>You can examine the boxtype in by doing
<tt>box->box()</tt>.  Fltk uses method name overloading to make
short names for get/set methods.  A "set" method is always of the form 
"<tt>void&nbsp;name(type)</tt>", and a "get" method is always of the form
"<tt>type&nbsp;name()&nbsp;const</tt>".

<p>Almost all of these set/get pairs are very fast and short inline
functions and thus very efficient.  However, <i>the "set" methods do
not call redraw()</i>, you have to call it yourself.  This greatly
reduces code size and execution time.  The only common exception is
<tt>value()</tt>, this does redraw() if necessary.

<h3>Begin/End of groups and windows</h3>

Then we indicate we are done adding widgets to the window:

<pre>
window-&gt;<A href=Fl_Group.html#end>end</A>();
</pre>

<p>To simplify the code you have to write, the constructor for all
widgets automatically adds them as children of the most recent <a
href=Fl_Group.html>Fl_Group</a> or <a
href=Fl_Window.html>Fl_Window</a> that was created. Though convienent,
this is also a big source of errors in FLTK programming. The method <A
href=Fl_Group.html#end>Fl_Group::end()</A> restores the
"current group" to the parent of itself, in this case it is set to
null because the window has no parent.  You may also find it useful to
call <a href=Fl_Group.html#current>Fl_Group::current(0)</a>
to turn this off completely.

<h3>Showing the Window</h3>

Then we cause the window to appear on the screen:

<pre>
window-&gt;<A href=Fl_Window.html#show>show</A>(argc, argv);
</pre>

<p>For the first Fl_Window you can provide the command-line arguments,
this runs a rather simple default argument parser that lets the user
customize the appearance, size, and position of your windows (you are
not required to use this argument parser, and just calling
<tt>show()</tt> with no arguments does not do this).

<p>(On some systems the window does not <i>actually</i> appear until
<tt>Fl::run()</tt> is called, which flushes the cached instructions to
the window server).

<h3>The Main Event Loop</h3>

<pre>
return <A href=Fl.html#run>Fl::run</A>();
</pre>

This will repeatedly wait for and then process events from the user.
<TT>Fl::run()</TT> does not return until all of the windows under FLTK 
control are closed (either by the user or your program).

<p>When the user attempts to close the window, the <a
href=Fl_Widget.html#callback>callback</a> for the window is
called. If you don't change it, the callback will remove the window
from the screen.

<p>You can replace this callback with your own code, so you can
prevent the window from closing, or pop up a confirmation, or create
another window, or you can call <tt>exit(0)</tt> if you want to exit
when the user closes the "main" window even if other windows are still
open.

<p>FLTK was designed to not take over the main event loop. Instead a
program can call <A href=Fl.html#wait><TT>Fl::wait()</TT></A>,
which will pause until "something happens" and then return. A program
can call <tt>Fl::wait()</tt> repeatedly or mix it with other
calculations. You can do this if there are no windows displayed
(useful if you used <a href=Fl.html#add_fd><TT>Fl::add_fd()</tt></a>).
The <tt>Fl::run()</tt> method is equivalent to:

<pre>
while (Fl::first_window()) Fl::wait();
return 0;
</pre>

<a name=compiling><h2>Compiling your program</h2>

You will probably need to tell the compiler where to find the
directory "fltk" with all the header files. This is usually done using
the <TT>-I</TT> option added to the compiler line:

<pre>
c++ -I/usr/local/include ...
</pre>

(In Visual C++ this can be done by selecting "Settings" from the
"Project" menu and then changing the "Preprocessor" settings under the
"C/C++" tab)

<p>Similarly, when linking your application you will need to tell the 
compiler to use the FLTK library and where to find it:

<pre>
c++ ... -L/usr/local/lib -lfltk -lXext -lX11 -lm
</pre>

(In Visual C++ you need to add the FLTK library to the "Link"
settings).
