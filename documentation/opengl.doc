/*! \page opengl Using OpenGL in FLTK

The easiest way to make an OpenGL display is to subclass
fltk::GlWindow. Your subclass must implement a GlWindow::draw()
method which uses OpenGL calls to draw the display.  Your main program 
should call Widget::redraw() when the display needs to change, and 
(somewhat later) FLTK will call draw() for you.

The functions glstart() and glfinish() may allow you to use OpenGL to
draw into any normal FLTK window or widget.  This allows you to use
Gouraud shading for drawing your widgets.

<h2>Making a Subclass of fltk::GlWindow</h2>

To define the subclass you just subclass the GlWindow class:

\code
class MyWindow : public fltk::GlWindow {
  void draw();
  int handle(int);

public:
  MyWindow(int X, int Y, int W, int H, const char *L)
    : fltk::GlWindow(X, Y, W, H, L) {}
};
\endcode

Like any widget, you can include additional private and public data in 
your class (such as scene graph information, etc.) 

The <TT>draw()</TT> method is where you actually do your OpenGL 
drawing. The header file gl.h provides some convinence functions
so that you can reuse FLTK fonts and colors in your OpenGL drawing:

\code
void MyWindow::draw() {
  if (!valid()) {
    ... set up projection, viewport, etc ...
    ... window size is in w() and h().
    ... valid() is turned on by FLTK after draw() returns
  }
  ... draw ...
}
\endcode

The <TT>handle()</TT> method handles mouse and keyboard events for the 
window: 

\code
int MyWindow::handle(int event) {
  switch(event) {
  case fltk::PUSH:
    ... mouse down event ...
    ... position in fltk::event_x() and fltk::event_y()
    return 1;
  case fltk::DRAG:
    ... mouse moved while down event ...
    return 1;
  case fltk::RELEASE:    
    ... mouse up event ...
    return 1;
  case fltk::FOCUS :
  case fltk::UNFOCUS :
    ... Return 1 if you want keyboard events, 0 otherwise
    return 1;
  case fltk::KEY:
    ... keypress, key is in fltk::event_key(), ascii in fltk::event_text()
    ... Return 1 if you understand/use the keyboard event, 0 otherwise...
    return 1;
  case fltk::SHORTCUT:
    ... shortcut, key is in fltk::event_key(), ascii in fltk::event_text()
    ... Return 1 if you understand/use the shortcut event, 0 otherwise...
    return 1;
  default:
    // let the base class handle all other events:
    return fltk::GlWindow::handle(event);
  }
}
\endcode

Note that the event_y() is in FLTK coordinates, with 0 at the top of
the window. Use h()-event_y() to get OpenGL coordinates with 0 at the
bottom.

handle() may make OpenGL calls if it first calls GlWindow::make_current().
If this is not done, the current OpenGL context may be another window. You
should only call non-drawing functions in handle():

\code
  case fltk::PUSH:
    make_current(); // make OpenGL context current
    if (!valid()) {
      ... set up projection exactly the same as draw ...
      valid(1); // stop it from doing this next time
    }
    ... ok to call NON-DRAWING OpenGL code here, such as hit
    detection, loading textures, etc...
\endcode

Your main program can now create one of your windows by doing <TT>new 
MyWindow(...)</TT>.  You can also use <A href=fluid.html>FLUID</A>
by: 
- Putting your class definition in a <tt>MyWindow.h</tt> file.
- Creating a <tt>fltk::InvisibleBox</tt> widget in FLUID.
- In the widget panel fill in the "class" field with <tt>MyWindow</tt>.
This will make FLUID produce constructors for your new class.
- In the "Extra Code" field put <TT>#include "MyWindow.h"</TT>, so that
the FLUID output file will compile.

<h2><a name=glspeed>Speeding up OpenGL</a></h2>

Performance of fltk::GlWindow may be improved on some types of OpenGL
implementations (in particular MESA or other software emulators) by
setting the <tt>GL_SWAP_TYPE</tt> environment variable.  This variable
declares what is in the back buffer after you do a swapbuffers.

<ul>

<li><tt>setenv GL_SWAP_TYPE COPY</tt>

This indicates that the back buffer is copied to the front buffer,
and still contains it's old data. This is true of many hardware
implementations.  Setting this will speed up emulation of
overlays, and widgets that can do partial update can take
advantage of this as damage() will not be cleared to -1.

<li><tt>setenv GL_SWAP_TYPE NODAMAGE</tt>

This indicates that nothing changes the back buffer except drawing
into it.  This is true of MESA and Win32 software emulation and
perhaps some hardware emulation on systems with lots of memory.

<li>All other values for <tt>GL_SWAP_TYPE</tt>, and not setting the variable,
cause fltk to assumme that the back buffer must be completely
redrawn after a swap.

</ul>

This is easily tested by running the gl_overlay demo program and
seeing if the display is correct when you drag another window over
it or if you drag the window off the screen and back on. You have to
exit and run the program again for it to see any changes to the
environment variable.

<h2><a name=gloptimizer>Using OpenGL Optimizer with FLTK</a></h2>

<A href=http://www.sgi.com/software/optimizer>OpenGL Optimizer</A> is a 
scene graph toolkit for OpenGL available from Silicon Graphics for IRIX 
and Microsoft Windows.  Versions are in the works for Solaris and 
HP-UX.  It allows you to view large scenes without writing a lot of 
OpenGL code. 
<H4>OptimizerWindow Class Definition</H4>
 To use OpenGL Optimizer with FLTK you'll need to create a subclass of <TT>
fltk::Gl_Widget</TT> that includes several state variables: 
<PRE>
class OptimizerWindow : public fltk::GlWindow {
  csContext *context_; // Initialized to 0 and set by draw()...
  csDrawAction *draw_action_; // Draw action...
  csGroup *scene_; // Scene to draw...
  csCamara *camera_; // Viewport for scene...

  void draw();

public:
  OptimizerWindow(int X, int Y, int W, int H, const char *L)
    : fltk::GlWindow(X, Y, W, H, L) {
      context_ = (csContext *)0;
      draw_action_ = (csDrawAction *)0;
      scene_ = (csGroup *)0;
      camera_ = (csCamera *)0;
    }

  void scene(csGroup *g) { scene_ = g; redraw(); }

  void camera(csCamera *c) {
    camera_ = c;
    if (context_) {
      draw_action_-&gt;setCamera(camera_);
      camera_-&gt;draw(draw_action_);
      redraw();
    }
  }
};
</PRE>
<PRE>

</PRE>
<H4>The camera() Method</H4>
 The <TT>camera()</TT> method sets the camera (projection and 
viewpoint) to use when drawing the scene. The scene is redrawn after 
this call. 
<H4>The draw() Method</H4>
 The <TT>draw()</TT> method performs the needed initialization and does 
the actual drawing: 
<PRE>
void OptimizerWindow::draw() {
  if (!context_) {
    // This is the first time we've been asked to draw; create the
    // Optimizer context for the scene...

#ifdef WIN32
    context_ = new csContext((HDC)fltk::getHDC());
    context_-&gt;ref();
    context_-&gt;makeCurrent((HDC)fltk::getHDC());
#else
    context_ = new csContext(fltk::display, fltk::visual);
    context_-&gt;ref();
    context_-&gt;makeCurrent(fltk::display, fltk::window);
#endif // WIN32

    ... perform other context setup as desired ...    

    // Then create the draw action to handle drawing things...

    draw_action_ = new csDrawAction;
    if (camera_) {
      draw_action_-&gt;setCamera(camera_);
      camera_-&gt;draw(draw_action_);
    }
  } else {
#ifdef WIN32
    context_-&gt;makeCurrent((HDC)fltk::getHDC());
#else
    context_-&gt;makeCurrent(fltk::display, fltk::window);
#endif // WIN32
  }

  if (!valid()) {
    // Update the viewport for this context...
    context_-&gt;setViewport(0, 0, w(), h());
  }

  // Clear the window...

  context_-&gt;clear(csContext::COLOR_CLEAR | csContext::DEPTH_CLEAR,
                  0.0f,		// Red
		  0.0f,		// Green
		  0.0f,		// Blue
		  1.0f);	// Alpha

  // Then draw the scene (if any)...

  if (scene_)
    draw_action_-&gt;apply(scene_);
}
</PRE>

<h4>The scene() Method</h4>

The <TT>scene()</TT> method sets the scene to be drawn.  The scene is 
a collection of 3D objects in a <TT>csGroup</TT>.  The scene is redrawn 
after this call.
