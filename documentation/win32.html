<h1 align=right>H - WIN32-Specific Interface</A></h1>

<h1><tt>#include &lt;FL/x.H&gt;</tt></h1>

The <TT>&lt;FL/x.H&gt;</TT> header file defines the interface to FLTK's 
WIN32-specific functions.  Be warned that some of the structures and 
calls in it are subject to change in future version of FLTK.  Try to 
avoid doing this so your code is portable.

<p>This is the same file that the X-specific interface uses, a
<tt>#ifdef WIN32</tt> in it causes the win32 header portion to be used.
Because many of the system-specific calls have the same names (just
different argument) you can write interesting "portable" system
specific code.

<p>Fltk creates a single WNDCLASSEX called &quot;FLTK&quot;.  The
window class is created the first time <TT>Fl_Window::show()</TT> is
called.

<P>You can probably combine FLTK with other libraries that make their
own WIN32 window classes.  The easiest way is to call
<TT>Fl::wait()</TT>, it will call <TT>DispatchMessage</TT> for all
messages to the other windows.  If necessary you can let the other
library take over (as long as it calls <TT>DispatchMessage()</TT>),
but you will have to arrange for the function <a
href=functions.html#flush><TT>Fl::flush()</TT></a> to be called
regularily so that widgets are updated. Timeouts, the idle function,
and file descriptor callbacks will not work in this case.

<h4><A name=add_handler>void Fl::add_handler(int (*f)(int))</A></h4>

Install a function to parse unrecognized messages sent to FLTK 
windows.  If FLTK cannot figure out what to do with a message, it calls 
each of these functions (most recent first) until one of them returns 
non-zero.  The argument passed to the fuctions is zero.  If all the 
handlers return zero then FLTK calls <TT>DefWindowProc()</TT>. 

<h4><A name=fl_msg>extern MSG fl_msg</A></h4>

The most recent message read by <TT>GetMessage</TT> (which is called 
by <A href=functions.html#wait><TT>Fl::wait()</TT></A>.  This may not 
be the most recent message sent to an FLTK window (because our
fun-loving friends at MicroSoft decided that calling the handle
procedures directly would be a good idea sometimes...)

<h4><A name=WIN32.fl_xid>HWND fl_xid(const Fl_Window*)</A></h4>

Returns the window handle for a <TT>Fl_Window</TT>, or zero if not
<TT>shown()</TT>.

<h4><A name=WIN32.fl_find>Fl_Window* fl_find(HWND xid)</A></h4>

Return the <TT>Fl_Window</TT> that corresponds to the given window 
handle, or <TT>NULL</TT> if not found.  This uses a cache so it is 
slightly faster than iterating through the windows yourself. 

<h4><A name=fl_display>extern HINSTANCE fl_display;</h4>

This is set on program initialization to <tt>GetModuleHandle(0)</tt>
and can be used to identify this application.

<h4><a name=fl_window>extern HWND fl_window;
<br><a name=fl_gc>extern HDC fl_gc;</h4>

These are set before <tt>draw()</tt> is called, or by <a
href=Fl_Window.html#make_current><tt>Fl_Window::make_current()</tt></a>,
and can be used as arguments to GDI32 calls.

<p>Notice that <tt>fl_window</tt> is the window handle.  Other
information such as the position or size of the window can be found
by looking at <A href=Fl_Window.html#make_current><TT>
Fl_Window::current()</TT></A>, which returns a pointer to the <TT>
Fl_Window</TT> being drawn.

<h4><a name=fl_wincolor>COLORREF fl_wincolor(Fl_Color i);</h4>

Returns the <tt>COLORREF</tt> fltk will use for the given fltk color,
typically this is <tt>RGB(r,g,b)</tt> of the color, or
<tt>PALETTEINDEX(RGB(r,g,b))</tt> if there is a palette.

<h4><a name=fl_colorref>extern COLORREF fl_colorref;
<br><a name=fl_pen>extern HPEN fl_pen;
<br><a name=fl_brush>extern HBRUSH fl_brush;</h4>

These are set by <a href=drawing.html#fl_color><tt>fl_color()</tt></a>
and by <a href=drawing.html#fl_line_style><tt>fl_line_style()</tt></a>,
by using these in your drawing calls you can provide the illusion that
GDI has a color in it's graphics state.

<h4><a name=fl_palette>extern HPALETTE fl_palette;</h4>

If non-zero this is the palette alloced by fltk on an 8-bit
screen. Hopefully you can ignore this, they managed to find a way to
make it <i>more</i> ugly than the X system, which is truly a triumph
of software engineering!

<h4><a name=icon>void Fl_Window::icon(char*)</h4>

Sets the icon for the window to the passed pointer.  You will need to 
cast the <TT>HICON</TT> handle to a <TT>char*</TT> when calling this 
method. To set the icon using an icon resource compiled with your 
application use: 

<UL><PRE>
window-&gt;icon((char*)LoadIcon(fl_display, MAKEINTRESOURCE(IDI_ICON)));
</PRE></UL>

<p>This only works if called <i>before</i> it is shown using the
<TT>Fl_Window::show()</TT> method.

<h3>How to Not Get a MSDOS Console Window</h3>

WIN32 has a really stupid mode switch stored in the executables that 
controls whether or not to make a console window. 

<P>To always get a console window you create a console application
(the &quot;/SUBSYSTEM:CONSOLE&quot; option for the linker). This works
fine but there is no way to stop Windows from popping up a terminal if
you run the program from the GUI.

<p>For a GUI-only application create a WIN32 application (the
&quot;/SUBSYSTEM:WINDOWS&quot; option for the linker).
FLTK provides a WinMain() function can be overridden by an application and
is provided for compatibility with programs written for other
operating systems that conform to the ANSI standard entry point
<tt>main()</tt>.  This will allow you to build a WIN32 Application
without having to change your source files.

<p>Because of problems with the Microsoft Visual C++ header files
and/or compiler, you cannot have a WinMain function in a DLL.
I don't know why.  Thus, this nifty feature is only available
if you link to the static library. You may want to compile the souce
file <tt>fl_call_main.c</tt> to a .obj and link it with your program
when using the DLL version of fltk.

<P>WIN32 applications without a console cannot write to <TT>stdout</TT>
or <TT>stderr</TT>, <i>even if they are run from a console window</i>.  Any 
output is silently thrown away. We are not sure why, but we do
question the sanity of the software engineers there sometimes.
If FLTK is compiled with <tt>-DDEBUG</tt> then the WinMain will
create a console window for your application so you can put printf()
statements for debugging or informational purposes.

<h3>Known Bugs</h3>

If a program is deactivated, <TT>Fl::wait()</TT> does not return until 
it is activated again, even though many events are delivered to the 
program. This can cause idle background processes to stop unexpectedly. 
This also happens while the user is dragging or resizing windows or 
otherwise holding the mouse down.  I was forced to remove most of the 
efficiency FLTK uses for redrawing in order to get windows to update 
while being moved.  This is a design error in WIN32 and probably 
impossible to get around. 

<P>Cut text contains ^J rather than ^M^J to break lines.  This is a 
feature, not a bug.

<p>The <tt>WinMain</tt> is a horrid mess and always breaking. This is
due to a concentrated effort by MicroSoft to make it impossible to
make portable programs without <tt>#ifdef</tt> statements.
