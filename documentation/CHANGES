	greatly simplified Fl_Group.
3/21/97: Added glXReleaseBuffersMESA if #ifdef MESA
3/7/97: Renamed some source files to avoid name conflicts on MSWindows.

	the close box from closing a window is to subclass it and

	however, before closing the window.  Added exit() and error()
	methods to Fl class, which you can "override" by defining
	your own versions in your source code.
1/24/97: Restored setting of XSizeHints (many window managers ignore
	the Motif window information).

FL-0.93

1/23/97: Got it to compile and run (with -DNO_GL) on Dec Alpha Unix!
	Mostly this meant getting rid of trailing commas on enum lists.
1/20/97: DDForms-compatable resize behavior, where it scales
	everything inside the resizebox.  Also fixed resizing of a
	group inside a window.

1/11/97: Fl_Browser now has a topline() attribute that you can get
	and set, as well as the Fl_Browser_::position() attribute.
	topline() is in lines, position() is in pixels.
1/11/97: General code clean up and size reduction.
1/11/97: Fl_Group::focus(x) fixed to always work

10/31/96: New fl->wait() and fl->check() handling so that flip
	book program would work.

10/09/96: Added the Fl_Input_ base class.
09/25/96: All constructors of the form Fl_x(x,y,w,h,label=0).

09/10/96: Constructor no longer does add().
09/07/96: FL_SHORTCUT is sent mouse window rather than focus window

08/14/96: Added scandir.c from the GNU C library for SVR4
08/13/96: makefiles have LIBNAME, VERSION, and REVISION switches
08/13/96: added (completely untested!) makeinclude.linux.so to make
	a shared library.  I recommend however that if you are making
	programs for any kind of distribution that you use the static
	version of the library, rather than relying on users correctly
	installing the shared one!
08/13/96: fixed *many* occurances of wrong scoping of for(int x;;)
08/13/96: patched out warning messages for enumerations from gcc.
08/13/96: fixed crash for fixed-pitch XFonts (per_char ptr is NULL)

08/13/96: Added switches so arrows can't navigate between text fields
08/13/96: Initializes some stuff it should have in Fl_Menu_Button.
08/13/96: Non-multiline Fl_Inputs do not treat ^J characters as
	special, for instance ^K always deletes to the end even if
	there are imbedded newlines.
08/13/96: Tab inserts a tab in Fl_MultiLine_Input.  Use Ctrl+Tab to navigate
08/10/96: renamed from libFL to libFl to avoid existing SGI library
08/10/96: the static Fl_Object method readqueue has been moved to
	a method on the Fl object.
08/10/96: the static Fl_Object method draw_box() renamed fl_box() and
	put in Draw.H
08/10/96: fl_label_bitmap has been renamed fl_draw and put in Draw.H
08/10/96: fixed the deactivated menu items to not draw over the right edge.
08/09/96: fl_clip works in both X and GL windows when USE_X is defined.
08/09/96: the static Fl_Object methods event_inside and test_shortcut
	have been moved to methods on the Fl object.
	The static Fl_Object method shortcut_text has been renamed
	to a function fl_shortcut_text and put in the Draw.H header.
08/09/96: many internal changes to Fl_Group and Fl_Window to support
	minimal update.  expose() is no longer a virtual function and
	is private to Fl_Window.  Fl_Object::flush() and qredraw()
	deleted.  New methods: draw_child(), redraw_child(), and
	done_drawing(), for calling by draw() implementations.
	See (not yet written) drawing documentation.
08/05/96: to make it possible to do minimal update, Fl_Group must draw
	everything outside of the object's bounding box.  So draw_label()
	changed to only draw FL_INSIDE or FL_CENTER alignements.  New
	method draw_outside_label() added to be called by Fl_Group
	to draw the other labels.  This simplified Fl_Slider and
	Fl_LightButton some, too.
