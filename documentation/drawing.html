<h1>Drawing Things in FLTK</h1>

This chapter covers the drawing functions that are provided with FLTK. 

<a name=dwhen><h2>When Can You Draw Things in FLTK?</h2></a>

There are only certain places you can execute drawing code in FLTK. 
Calling these functions at other places will result in undefined 
behavior! 

<ul>

<li>The most common is inside the virtual method <A
href=subclassing.html#draw><tt> Fl_Widget::draw()</tt></A>.  To write
code here, you must subclass one of the existing <tt>Fl_Widget</tt>
classes and implement your own version of <tt>draw()</tt>. 

<li>You can also write <a href=Fl_Boxtype.html>boxtypes</A> and <A
href=Fl_Labeltype.html> labeltypes</A>.  These are small structures
with functions in them that rae called by existing
<tt>Fl_Widget::draw()</tt> methods.  Pointers to these
structures are stored in the widget's <tt>box()</tt> ,
<tt>labeltype()</tt>, and possibly other properties. 

<li>You can write <a href=Fl_Image.html>Fl_Image</a> classes, which
can then be put into the <a
href=Fl_Widget.html#image>Fl_Widget::image()</a> and be called by
existing <tt>Fl_Widget::draw()</tt> methods.

<li>You can call <A href=Fl_Window.html#make_current><tt>
Fl_Window::make_current()</tt></A> to do incremental update of a 
widget. Use <A href=Fl_Widget.html#window><tt>
Fl_Widget::window()</tt></A> to  find the window.

</ul>

<a name=dfunc><H2>FLTK Drawing Functions</H2></a>

To use the drawing functions you must first include the <tt>
&lt;fltk/fl_draw.h&gt;</tt> header file.  FLTK provides the following types of 
drawing functions: 

<ul>
<li><A href=#dtransformation>Transformation</A>
<li><A href=#dclipping>Clipping</A>
<li><A href=#dcolors>Colors</A>
<li><A href=#dlines>Line dashes and thickness</A>
<li><A href=#dpath>Path construction and drawing</A>
<li><A href=#dfast>Drawing that bypasses the path stuff</A>
<li><A href=#dtext>Text</A>
<li><A href=#dimages>Images</A>
</ul>

<a name=dtransformation><h2>Current Transformation</h2></a>

FLTK provides an arbitrary 2-D linear transformation (ie rotation,
scale, skew, reflections, and translation).

<p><i>To speed up implementations (or make them possible on some
devices) many of the drawing commands ignore anything other than the
translation, and often they round the translation to the nearest
integer.</i> The only commands guaranteed to obey the rotation and
scale of the transfromation are <a
href="#fl_vertex"><tt>fl_vertex</tt></a>, <a
href="#fl_curve"><tt>fl_curve</tt></a>, and <a
href="#fl_arc"><tt>fl_arc</tt></a>. Conversely, do not rely on the
transformation being ignored by an operator either!

<h4><a name=fl_push_matrix>void fl_push_matrix()</a>
<br><a name=fl_pop_matrix>void fl_pop_matrix()</a></h4>

Save and restore the current transformation.  The maximum depth of the 
stack is 10.

<h4><a name=fl_scale>void fl_scale(float x, float y)
<br>void fl_scale(float x)</a>
<br><a name=fl_translate>void fl_translate(float x, float y)</a>
<br><a name=fl_rotate>void fl_rotate(float d)</a>
<br><a name=fl_mult_matrix>void fl_mult_matrix(float a,  float b,  float c,  float d,  float x,  float y)</a></h4>

Concatenate another transformation onto the current one.  The rotation 
angle is in degrees (not radians) and is counter-clockwise. 

<h4><a name=fl_transform_x>double fl_transform_x(double x, double y)</a>
<br><a name=fl_transform_y>double fl_transform_y(double x, double y)</a></h4>

Return the actual x (or y) coordinate after x,y is transformed by the
current transform. This value may be passed to
<tt>fl_transformed_vertex</tt> or to the functions that dont do
transforms yet, like <tt><a href=#fl_draw>fl_draw</a></tt> (but be warned that these may
change in future versions).

<h4><a name=fl_transform_dx>double fl_transform_dx(double x, double y)</a>
<br><a name=fl_transform_dy>double fl_transform_dy(double x, double y)</a></h4>

Similar, but the translation is ignored, so this transforms a distance
vector, instead of an actual point.

<A name=dclipping><h2>Clipping</h2></a>

You can limit all your drawing to a region by calling <tt>
fl_push_clip</tt>, and put the drawings back by using <tt>fl_pop_clip</tt>.
Fltk may also set up clipping before draw() is called to limit the
drawing to the region of the window that is damaged.

<p>When drawing you can also test the current clip region with
<tt>fl_not_clipped()</tt> and <tt>fl_clip_box()</tt>.  By using these
to skip over complex drawings that are clipped you can greatly speed
up your program's redisplay.

<p>The clip region is measured in pixels (it is unaffected by the current 
transformation matrix). 

<a name=fl_push_clip><h4>void fl_push_clip(int x, int y, int w, int h)</h4></a>

Pushes the <i>intersection</i> of the current region and this
rectangle onto the clip stack.

<a name=fl_clip_out><h4>void fl_clip_out(int x, int y, int w, int h)</h4></a>

Remove the rectangle from the current clip region, thus making it a
more complex shape.  This does not push the stack, it just replaces
the top of it. <i>This does not work on X or Win32 unless
<tt>fl_push_clip()</tt> has been called at least once.</i>

<a name=fl_push_no_clip><h4>void fl_push_no_clip()</h4></a>

Pushes an empty clip region on the stack so nothing will be clipped.
This lets you draw outside the current clip region.  <i>You should not
use this :-)</i>

<a name=fl_pop_clip><h4>void fl_pop_clip()</h4></a>

Restore the previous clip region. <I>You must call
<tt>fl_pop_clip()</tt> exactly once for every time you call
<tt>fl_clip()</tt>.  If you return to FLTK with the clip stack not
empty unpredictable results occur.</I>

<a name=fl_not_clipped><h4>int fl_not_clipped(int x, int y, int w, int h)</h4></a>

Return non-zero if the intersection of the rectangle and the current
clip region is non-zero.  If this returns zero you don't have to draw
anything in that rectangle.  <I>Under X this returns 1 if the
interesection is equal to the rectangle, and 2 if the intersection is
only part of the rectangle.</i>

<a name=fl_clip_box><h4>int fl_clip_box(int x, int y, int w, int h, int& X, int& Y, int& W, int& H)</h4></a>

Find the smallest rectangle that surrounds the intersection of the
rectangle <tt>x,y,w,h</tt> with the current clip region.  This
"bounding box" is returned in <tt>X,Y,W,H</tt>.  The return value is
non-zero if the bounding box is different than the rectangle.  If the
intersection is empty then <tt>W</tt> and <tt>H</tt> are set to zero.

<p>This can be used to limit complex pixel operations (like drawing
images) to the smallest rectangle needed to update the visible area.

<h2><a name=dcolors>Colors</a></h2>

<a name=fl_color><h4>void fl_color(<a href=Fl_Color.html>Fl_Color</a>)</h4></a>

Set the color for all subsequent drawing operations. <tt><a
href=Fl_Color.html>Fl_Color</a></tt> is a typedef for a 32-bit integer
containing r,g,b bytes and an "index" byte.  The index is used if
r,g,b is zero. For instance <tt>0xFF008000</tt> is 255 red, zero
green, and 128 blue.

<p>(On non-TrueColor X displays fltk rounds the desired color to the
nearest color in a small (200) set of colors and allocates that from X
to avoid consuming the entire colormap. On Windows colormapped displays
the system dithering is used for all colors, which looks lousy, but
Windows does not have the defective X behavior and thus you usually
are not forced to set the screen to 8-bit mode)

<a href=Fl_Color.html><h4>Fl_Color fl_color()</h4></a>

Returns the last <tt>fl_color()</tt> that was set.  This can be used 
for state save/restore.

<a name=dlines><h2>Line dashes and thickness</h2></a>

<a name=fl_line_style><h4>void fl_line_style(int style, int width=0, char* dashes=0)</h4></a>

Set how to draw lines (the "pen").  If you change this it is your
responsibility to set it back to the default with
<tt>fl_line_style(0)</tt>.

<p><i>style</i> is a bitmask in which you 'or' the following values.  If
you don't specify a dash type you will get a solid line.  If you don't
specify a cap or join type you will get a system-defined default of
whatever value is fastest.

<ul>
<li><tt>FL_SOLID&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -------</tt>
<li><tt>FL_DASH&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - - - -</tt>
<li><tt>FL_DOT&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .......</tt>
<li><tt>FL_DASHDOT&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - . - .</tt>
<li><tt>FL_DASHDOTDOT - .. -</tt>
<li><tt>FL_CAP_FLAT</tt>
<li><tt>FL_CAP_ROUND</tt>
<li><tt>FL_CAP_SQUARE</tt> (extends past end point 1/2 line width)
<li><tt>FL_JOIN_MITER</tt> (pointed)
<li><tt>FL_JOIN_ROUND</tt>
<li><tt>FL_JOIN_BEVEL</tt> (flat)
</ul>

<p><i>width</i> is the number of pixels thick to draw the lines.  Zero
results in the system-defined default, which on both X and Windows is
somewhat different and nicer than 1.

<p><i>dashes</i> is a pointer to an array of dash lengths, measured in
pixels.  The first location is how long to draw a solid portion, the
next is how long to draw the gap, then the solid, etc.  It is
terminated with a zero-length entry.  A null pointer or a zero-length
array results in a solid line. Odd array sizes are not supported and
result in undefined behavior.  <i>The dashes array does not work on
Windows 95/98, use the dash styles instead.</i>

<h2><a name=dpath>Path construction and drawing</a></h2>

These functions let you draw arbitrary shapes with 2-D linear
transformations.  The functionality matches that found in Adobe&reg;
PostScript<SUP>TM</SUP>. On both X and WIN32 the transformed vertices are
rounded to integers before drawing the line segments: this severely
limits the accuracy of these functions for complex graphics, so use
OpenGL when greater accuracy and/or performance is required.

<a name=fl_newpath><h4>void fl_newpath()</h4></a>

Clear the current "path". This is normally done by fl_fill() or any
other drawing command.

<a name=fl_vertex><h4>void fl_vertex(float x, float y)</h4></a>

Add a single vertex to the current path. (If you are familiar with
PostScript, this does a "moveto" if the path is clear or fl_closepath
was done last, otherwise it does a "lineto").

<h4>void fl_vertex(int x, int y)</h4>

Add a single vertex to the current path. <i>The current
transformation, other than integer translation, may be ignored on some
platforms, in order to make this faster! Use the double version if you
want the transform to work.</i>

<a name=fl_transformed_vertex><h4>void fl_transformed_vertex(float x, float y)</h4></a>

Add a single vertex to the current path. The passed values are not
transformed and may be based on values returned by
<tt>fl_transform_x()</tt>, <tt>fl_transform_y()</tt>, or
<tt>fl_transform_dx()</tt> or <tt>fl_transform_dy()</tt>.

<a name=fl_closepath><h4>void fl_closepath();</h4></a>

Similar to drawing another vertex back at the starting point, but fltk
knows the path is closed. The next <tt>fl_vertex</tt> will start a new
disconnected part of the shape.

<p>It is harmless to call <tt>fl_closepath()</tt> several times in a
row, or to call it before the first point. Sections with less than 3
points in them will not draw anything when filled.

<a name=fl_curve><h4>void fl_curve(float x, float y, float x1, float y1, float x2, float y2, float x3, float y3)</h4></a>

Add a series of points on a Bezier curve to the path.  The curve ends 
(and two of the points) are at <tt>x,y</tt> and <tt>x3,y3</tt>. 

<a name=fl_arc><h4>void fl_arc(float x, float y, float w, float h, float start, float end)</h4></a>

Add a series of points to the current path on the arc of an
ellipse. The ellipse in inscribed in the <tt>x,y,w,h</tt> rectangle,
and the <tt>start</tt> and <tt>end</tt> angles are measured in degrees
counter-clockwise from 3 o'clock, 45 points at the upper-right corner
of the rectangle.  If <tt> end</tt> is less than <tt>start</tt> then
it draws the arc in a clockwise direction.

<a name=fl_ellipse><h4>void fl_ellipse(float x, float y, float w, float h)</h4></a>

Does closepath() and then adds a series of points on the edge of an
ellipse inscribed in the given rectangle, then another closepath().

<p>This tries to take advantage of the primitive drawing provided by X
and Win32, which means it only draws the right thing if the rotation
is a multiple of 90 degrees, or if the shape is a circle. Currently
there can only be one ellipse or circle in a path.

<a name=fl_circle><h4>void fl_circle(float x, float y, float r)</h4></a>

<tt>fl_circle()</tt> draws a circle of radius r centered on the point
x,y. The result is always a circle, irregardless of scale. This also
tries to take advantage of the X/Win32 graphics primitives like fl_ellipse.

<a name=fl_points><h4> void fl_points()</h4></a>

Draw a point (one pixel) for every vertex in the path, then clear the path.

<a name=fl_stroke><h4> void fl_stroke()</h4></a>

Draw a line between all the points in the path (see fl_line_type() for
ways to set the thicknesss and dot pattern of the line).

<a name=fl_fill><h4>void fl_fill()</h4></a>

Does <tt>fl_closepath()</tt> and then fill with the current color.

<p>For portability, you should only draw polygons that appear the same
whether "even/odd" or "non-zero" winding rules are used to fill them.
This mostly means that holes should be drawn in the opposite direction
of the outside.

<a name=fl_fill_stroke><h4>void fl_fill_stroke(Fl_Color linecolor)</h4></a>

Does <tt>fl_fill()</tt>, then sets the current color to
<i>linecolor</i> and does <tt>fl_stroke</tt> with the same closed path.

<A name=dfast><h2>Drawing that bypasses the path mechanism</h2></a>

For speed and convienence, and to get some necessary graphics on the
rather primitive interface provided by X and Win32, fltk has some
calls that could be done with paths but are provided directly.

<a name=fl_rectf><h4>void fl_rectf(int x, int y, int w, int h)</h4></a>

Color a rectangle that exactly fills the given bounding box.

<h4>void fl_rectf(int x, int y, int w, int h, <a
href=Fl_Color.html>Fl_Color</a>)</h4>

Color a rectangle with "exactly" the passed <tt>r,g,b</tt> color.  On
screens with less than 24 bits of color this is done by drawing a
solid-colored block using <A
href=#fl_draw_image><tt>fl_draw_image()</tt> </A> so that dithering is
produced.

<a name=fl_rect><h4>void fl_rect(int x, int y, int w, int h)</h4></a>

Draw a line <I>inside</I> this bounding box (currently correct only
for 0-thickness lines).

<a name=fl_line><h4>void fl_line(int x, int y, int x1, int y1)</h4></a>

Draw a straight line between the two points.

<a name=fl_pie><h4>void fl_pie(int x, int y, int w, int h, double start, double end, int what=FL_PIE);</h4></a>

These functions match the rather limited circle drawing code provided
by X and WIN32.  The advantage over using <A
href=#fl_arc><tt>fl_arc</tt></A> is that they are faster because they
often use the hardware, and they draw much nicer small circles, since
the small sizes are often hard-coded bitmaps. Only the integer
translation of the current transformation is obeyed on most systems.

<p>The allowed types are:

<ul>

<li><tt>FL_PIE</tt> fills a pie-slice shape
<li><tt>FL_CHORD</tt> join the ends of the arc with a straight line
and fill.
<li><tt>FL_ARC</tt> stroke the curved edge of the arc.

</ul>

<a name=dtext><h2>Text</h2></a>

See <a href=Fl_Font.html>Fl_Font</a> for a description of what can be
passed as a font. For most uses one of the built-in constant fonts
like <tt>FL_HELVETICA</tt> can be used.

<A name=fl_font><h4>
void fl_font(<a href=Fl_Font.html>Fl_Font</a>, unsigned size)</h4></a>

Set the current font.  It is scaled so that the font height (sum of
ascent plus descent, minimum line spacing) is <i>size</i> pixels.
The font size is unaffected by the current transformation.

<p>The size is given in pixels. Many pieces of software express sizes
in "points" (for mysterious reasons, since everything else is measured
in pixels!). To convert these point sizes to pixel sizes use the
following code:

<ul><pre>
const Fl_Screen_Info& info = <a href="Fl.html#info">Fl::info()</a>;
double pixels_per_point = info.height/(info.height_mm*(72/25.4));
int font_pixel_size = int(font_point_size*pixels_per_point + .5)
</pre></ul>

<A name=fl_font_named><h4>void fl_font(const char* name, unsigned size);<br>
void fl_font(const char* name, int attributes, unsigned size);</h4></a>

Set the current font by name. Exactly what names work depend on your
system, it is best to use <a
href=Fl_Font.html#fl_list_fonts><tt>fl_list_fonts</tt></a> to see what
is provided. See <a
href=Fl_Font.html#fl_find_font><tt>fl_find_font</tt></a> for how the
name and attributes are interpreted.

<a name=fl_encoding><h4>void fl_encoding(const char*);</h4></a>

The encoding determines how the bytes sent to <a
href=#fl_draw>fl_draw</a> are turned into glyphs. If the current font
cannot do the encoding, some default encoding will be used (for
instance the Symbol font always works without having to set the
encoding).

<p>In current implementations you must call <a href=#fl_font>fl_font(...)</a>
after this for the change in encoding to take effect.

<p>The only way
to find out what encodings are going to work is to call <a
href=Fl_Font.html>Fl_Font::encodings()</a>.

<p>In general you should set this on startup to your locale, and leave
it alone. We hope to support UTF-8 encoding by default in fltk in the
future. It is likely that when this happens support for fl_encoding()
will be removed.

<p>The default is "iso8859-1"

<h4>Fl_Font fl_font()</h4>

Returns the current font.

<a name=fl_size><h4>unsigned fl_size()</h4></a>

Returns the current font size.

<h4>const char* fl_encoding();</h4>

Returns the current encoding.

<a name=fl_height><h4>int fl_height()</h4></a>

Returns the vertical size of the font according to the system.  It is
highly recommended that you use <tt>fl_size()</tt> instead for
portability and because many X fonts return erroneous values for this.

<a name=fl_descent><h4>int fl_descent()</h4></a>

Recommended distance above the bottom of a <tt>fl_height()</tt> tall 
box to draw the text at so it looks centered vertically in that box. 

<a name=fl_width><h4>int fl_width(const char*)
<BR>int fl_width(const char*, int n)
<BR>int fl_width(uchar)</h4></a>

Return the pixel width of a nul-terminated string, a sequence of
<tt>n</tt> characters, or a single character in the current font.

<a name=fl_draw><h4>void fl_draw(const char*, int x, int y)
<br>void fl_draw(const char*, int n, int x, int y)</h4></a>

Draw a nul-terminated string or an array of <tt>n</tt> characters 
starting at the given location. 

<h4>void fl_draw(const char*, int x, int y, int w, int h, Fl_Flags)</h4>

Fancy string drawing function which is used to draw all the labels.
The string is formatted and aligned inside the passed box.  Handles
'\t' and '\n', expands all other control characters to ^X, and aligns
inside or against the edges of the box.  See <A
href=Fl_Labeltype.html> <tt>Fl_Labeltype_::draw()</tt></A> for values
for the flags.  The value <tt>FL_ALIGN_INSIDE</tt> is ignored, as this
function always prints inside the box.

<a name=fl_measure><h4>void fl_measure(const char*, int& w, int& h)</h4></a>

Measure how wide and tall the string will be when printed by the
<tt>fl_draw(...align)</tt> function.  If the incoming <i>w</i> is
non-zero it will wrap to that width.

<a name=dimages><h2>Images</h2></a>

If you plan to draw the same image many times, you may want an <a
href=Fl_Image.html><tt>Fl_Image</tt></a> subclass such as <A
href=Fl_Bitmap.html><tt>Fl_Bitmap</tt></A>, <A
href=Fl_RGB_Image.html> <tt>Fl_RGB_Image</tt></A>, or <A
href=Fl_Pixmap.html><tt>Fl_Pixmap</tt></A> and call <a
href=Fl_Image.html#draw><tt>draw()</tt></a> on them. The advantage of
using the object is that FLTK will cache translated forms of the image
(on X it uses a server pixmap) and thus redrawing is <I>much</I>
faster.  In addition, on current systems, <tt>Fl_Image</tt> is the
only way to get transparency or to draw 1-bit bitmaps.

<p>The advantage of drawing directly is that it is more intuitive, and
it is faster if the image data changes more often than it is redrawn.

<p>Currently the image is only affected by the integer portion of the
current transformation. This may change in future versions!

<a name=fl_draw_image><h4>void fl_draw_image(const uchar*, int X, int Y, int W, int H, int D = 3, int LD = 0)
<br>void fl_draw_image_mono(const uchar*, int X, int Y, int W, int H, 
int D = 1, int LD = 0)</h4></a>

Draw an 8-bit per color RGB or luminance image.  The pointer points at
the byte of red data of the top-left pixel.  Data must be in <tt>r,g,b</tt>
order. <tt>X,Y</tt> are where to put the top-left corner. <tt>W</tt>
and <tt>H</tt> define the size of the image. <tt>D</tt> is the delta
to add to the pointer between pixels, it may be any value greater or
equal to <tt>3</tt>, or it can be negative to flip the image
horizontally. <tt>LD</tt> is the delta to add to the pointer between
lines (if 0 is passed it uses <tt>W * D</tt>), and may be larger than
<tt>W * D</tt> to crop data, or negative to flip the image vertically.

<P>It is highly recommended that you put the following code before the 
first <tt>show()</tt> of <I>any</I> window in your program to get rid 
of the dithering if possible:

<ul><pre><a name=Fl.html#visual>Fl::visual(FL_RGB);</a></pre></ul>

Gray scale (1-channel) images may be drawn.  This is done if <tt>abs(D)</tt>
is less than 3, or by calling <tt>fl_draw_image_mono()</tt>.  Only one 
8-bit sample is used for each pixel, and on screens with different 
numbers of bits for red, green, and blue only gray colors are used. 
Setting <tt>D</tt> greater than 1 will let you display one channel of 
a color image.

<P><I>The X version does not support all possible visuals.</I> If FLTK 
cannot draw the image in the current visual it will abort.  FLTK 
supports any visual of 8 bits or less, and all common TrueColor visuals 
up to 32 bits.

<h4>typedef void (*fl_draw_image_cb)(void*, int x, int y, int w, uchar 
*)
<BR>void fl_draw_image(fl_draw_image_cb, void*, int X, int Y, int W, 
int H, int D = 3)
<BR>void fl_draw_image_mono(fl_draw_image_cb, void*, int X, int Y, 
int W, int H, int D = 1)</h4>

Call the passed function to provide each scan line of the image.  This 
lets you generate the image as it is being drawn, or do arbitrary 
decompression of stored data (provided it can be decompressed to 
individual scan lines easily). 

<P>The callback is called with the <tt>void*</tt> user data pointer 
(this can be used to point at a structure of information about the 
image), and the <tt>x</tt>, <tt>y</tt>, and <tt>w</tt> of the scan line 
desired from the image.  0,0 is the upper-left corner (<I>not <tt>X,Y</tt>
</I>).  A pointer to a buffer to put the data into is passed.  You must 
copy <tt>w</tt> pixels from scanline <tt>y</tt>, starting at pixel <tt>x</tt>
, to this buffer.

<P>Due to cropping, less than the whole image may be requested.  So <tt>
x</tt> may be greater than zero, the first <tt>y</tt> may be greater 
than zero, and <tt>w</tt> may be less than <tt>W</tt>.  The buffer is 
long enough to store the entire <tt>W * D</tt> pixels, this is for 
convienence with some decompression schemes where you must decompress 
the entire line at once: decompress it into the buffer, and then if <tt>
x</tt> is not zero, copy the data over so the <tt>x</tt>'th pixel is at 
the start of the buffer.

<P>You can assume the <tt>y</tt>'s will be consecutive, except the 
first one may be greater than zero.

<P>If <tt>D</tt> is 4 or more, you must fill in the unused bytes with 
zero.
