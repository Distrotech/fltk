<H3>Description</H3>

This class is provided for back compatability with fltk 1.0 and should
not be used in new programs.

<p>In fltk 1.0 menu items were an array of these structures and the
array was managed by the user program, and a pointer to this array was
stored in the menu bar or button.

<p>In fltk 2.0 menu items are child widgets. This allows the same code
that adds, removes, or modifies widgets to be used to manage menu
items.

<p>Fltk 1.0 is emulated by replacing the methods that set the pointer
to the array with a method that reads the array and creates identical
menu items as widgets. The compatability is not exact, as attempts to
modify the menu entries by changing the array are ignored (since they
were copied at assignment time).
