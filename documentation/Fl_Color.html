<h1>typedef Fl_Color</h1>

Fl_Color is an unsigned integer.

<p>The (low) 4 bytes of the color are <b>rgbN</b>.  (<b>r</b> is the
byte with the highest <i>value</i>, not the first in memory.  On an
Intel or other little-endian machine the first byte in memory is
<b>N</b>, while on a big-endian machine such as a MIPS it is <b>r</b>)

<p><img src=fl_show_colormap.gif align=right>If the <b>rgb</b> is
zero, the <b>N</b> is the color "index".  This index is used to look
up an Fl_Color in an internal table of 256 colors, called the "fltk
color map", shown here.  Thus using any integer in the range 0-255 as
an Fl_Color will index the color map.  If <b>rgb</b> is not zero the
index value is ignored (future code may treat the last byte as an
"alpha" value).

<p>An Fl_Color of zero (<code>FL_NO_COLOR</code>) will draw black but
is ambiguous.  It is returned as an error value or to indicate
portions of a Fl_Style that should be inherited, and it is also used
as the default label color for everything so that changing color zero
can be used by the -fg switch.  You should use <code>FL_BLACK</code> (56)
to get black.

<p>The entries 1-31 in the color map are settable by the user program.
The advantage of using these over <a href=#fl_rgb>fl_rgb(r,g,b)</a> is
that they are reproduced exactly on 8-bit screens.  Normal rgb colors
are selected on 8-bit screens by using the nearest color from the
color cube.  Colors 1-15 are preset for back compatability but fltk no
longer uses these so you can change them.

<p>Entries 32-55 of the color map are a 24-entry "gray" ramp.  This
ramp is modified by the -bg switch or other user preferences so that
the entry <tt>FL_GRAY</tt> (49) is the background color, and the
others are a nice range from black to white.  These are used to draw
box edges.

<p>The remiander of the color map is a 5x8x5 color cube.  This cube is
used to dither images or <a href=drawing.html#fl_rectf>fl_rectf()</a>
on 8-bit screens.  In addition the symbols <code>FL_BLACK, FL_RED,
FL_GREEN, FL_YELLOW, FL_BLUE, FL_MAGENTA, FL_CYAN, FL_WHITE, and
FL_BLUE_SELECTION_COLOR</code> index the corners of the cube (these
have different values than fltk1.0!).

<h2>Methods and functions</h2>

<h4>Fl_Color fl_rgb(unsigned char r, unsigned char g, unsigned char
b)</h4>

Inline function to build a color out of individual bytes.  The index
is set to zero.

<a name=fl_rgb>
<h4>Fl_Color fl_rgb(const char*);</h4>

Return a named color, returns 0 if the name is not found (on X this
does Xlookupcolor, on Windows it can only do colors of the form #123456).

<h4>Fl_Color fl_color_average(Fl_Color A, Fl_Color B, double
weight);</h4>

Returns a color that is <code>weight*A+(1-weight)*B</code>.

<a name=fl_inactive>
<h4>Fl_Color fl_inactive(Fl_Color c);</h4>

Returns some color between c and FL_GRAY.

<a name=fl_contrast>
<h4>Fl_Color fl_contrast(Fl_Color fg, Fl_Color bg);</h4>

Decides if <i>fg</i> can be seen agains <i>bg</i> and returns
<i>fg</i> if so.  If not this returns either <code>FL_NO_COLOR</code>
or <code>FL_WHITE</code>, whichever one is more different than
<i>bg</i>.  This function is often used by fltk for labels and text
when no color is specified in the style.

<a name=fl_get_color>
<h4>Fl_Color fl_get_color(Fl_Color c);</h4>

If c is an indexed color, this returns the full rgb color from the
color map.  This returns c unchanged if it is not an indexed color.

<a name=fl_get_color>
<h4>void fl_get_color(Fl_Color c, uchar& r, uchar& g, uchar& b);</h4>

If c is an indexed color, this returns the full rgb color from the
color map.  This returns c unchanged if it is not an indexed color.
The rgb portions of the color are extracted and put in the passed
variables.

<a name=fl_set_color>
<h4>void fl_set_color(Fl_Color i, Fl_Color v);</h4>

Set entry <i>i</i> in the fltk color map to <i>v</i>.  <i>i</i> should
be in the range 1-31, and <i>v</i> should be an rgb color.

<a name=fl_free_color>
<h4>void fl_free_color(Fl_Color i);</h4>

Tell colormapped-display that we don't need this indexed color anymore.

<a name=fl_gray_ramp>
<h4>Fl_Color fl_gray_ramp(int i)</h4>

Return indexed color <i>i</i> from the gray ramp (this is a simple
inline function).  There are <code>FL_NUM_GRAY</code> (24) shades in
the gray ramp, with zero being black and 23 being white.

<a name=fl_color_cube>
<h4>Fl_Color fl_color_cube(int r, int g, int b)</h4>

Return a indexed color from the color cube.  Unless you really need
exact colors on an 8-bit screen you are better off using
<code>fl_rgb(r,g,b)</code>, which takes 8-bit numbers.  The three
arguments are indexes into the cube (not 8 bit numbers!), the number
of values in each index is <code>FL_NUM_RED</code>(5),
<code>FL_NUM_GREEN</code>(8) and <code>FL_NUM_BLUE</code>(5).
