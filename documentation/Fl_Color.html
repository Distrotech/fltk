<h2>typedef fltk::Color</h2>
<hr>

fltk::Color is an unsigned integer.

<p>The (low) 4 bytes of the color are <b>rgbN</b>.  (<b>r</b> is the
byte with the highest <i>value</i>, not the first in memory.  On an
Intel or other little-endian machine the first byte in memory is
<b>N</b>, while on a big-endian machine such as a MIPS it is <b>r</b>)

<p><img src=fl_show_colormap.gif align=right>If the <b>rgb</b> is
zero, the <b>N</b> is the color "index".  This index is used to look
up an fltk::Color in an internal table of 255 colors, called the "fltk
colormap", shown here.  Thus using any integer in the range 1-255 as
an fltk::Color will index the colormap.  If <b>rgb</b> is not zero the
index value is ignored (future code may treat the last byte as an
"alpha" value).

<p>An fltk::Color of zero (<code>fltk::NO_COLOR</code>) will draw black but
is ambiguous.  It is returned as an error value or to indicate
portions of a fltk::Style that should be inherited, and it is also used
as the default label color for everything so that changing color zero
can be used by the -fg switch.  You should use <code>fltk::BLACK</code> (56)
to get black.

<p>The entries 1-31 in the colormap are settable by the user program.
The advantage of using these over <a href=#rgb>fltk::rgb(r,g,b)</a> is
that they are reproduced <i>exactly</i> on 8-bit screens (normal rgb
colors are selected on 8-bit screens by using <a
href=#nearest_color>fltk::nearest_color()</a>).  Colors 1-15 are preset
for back compatability but fltk no longer uses these so you can change
them.

<p>Entries 32-55 of the colormap are a 24-entry "gray ramp".  This
ramp is modified by the -bg switch or by other code that calls <a
href="#background">fltk::background()</a> so that the color
<tt>fltk::GRAY</tt> (49) is the background color, and the others are a
nice range from black to white. These are used to draw box edges.

<p>The remiander of the colormap is a 5x8x5 color cube.  This cube is
used to dither images or <a href=drawing.html#rectf>fltk::rectf()</a>
on 8-bit screens.  In addition the symbols <code>fltk::BLACK, fltk::RED,
fltk::GREEN, fltk::YELLOW, fltk::BLUE, fltk::MAGENTA, fltk::CYAN, fltk::WHITE, and
fltk::BLUE_SELECTION_COLOR</code> index the corners of the cube (these
have different values than fltk1.0!).

<h3>Methods and functions</h3>

<a name=rgb>
<h4>fltk::Color fltk::rgb(unsigned char r, unsigned char g, unsigned char
b)</h4>

Inline function to build a color out of individual bytes.  The index
is set to zero.

<h4>fltk::Color fltk::rgb(const char*);</h4>

Return a named color, returns 0 if the name is not found (on X this
does Xlookupcolor, on Windows it can only do colors of the form #123456).

<h4>fltk::Color fltk::color_average(fltk::Color A, fltk::Color B, double
weight);</h4>

Returns a color that is <code>weight*A+(1-weight)*B</code>.

<h4><a name=inactive>fltk::Color fltk::inactive(fltk::Color c);</a></h4>

Returns some color between c and fltk::GRAY.

<h4>fltk::Color fltk::inactive(fltk::Color c, fltk::Flags f);</h4>

This returns <code>fltk::inactive(c)</code> if the bit
<code>fltk::INACTIVE</code> is turned on in <i>f</i>, otherwise <i>c</i>
is returned unchanged.

<a name=contrast>
<h4>fltk::Color fltk::contrast(fltk::Color fg, fltk::Color bg);</h4>

Decides if <i>fg</i> can be seen agains <i>bg</i> and returns
<i>fg</i> if so.  If not this returns either <code>fltk::NO_COLOR</code>
or <code>fltk::WHITE</code>, whichever one is more different than
<i>bg</i>.  This function is often used by fltk for labels and text
when no color is specified in the style.

<a name=get_color>
<h4>fltk::Color fltk::get_color(fltk::Color c);</h4>

Turns an indexed color into an rgb color by looking it up in the
colormap.  If <i>c</i> is not an indexed color it is returned
unchanged.

<h4>void fltk::get_color(fltk::Color c, uchar& r, uchar& g, uchar& b);</h4>

Turns an indexed color into an rgb color if necessary, and then
the rgb portions of the color are extracted and put in the passed
variables.

<a name=nearest_color>
<h4>fltk::Color fltk::nearest_color(fltk::Color c);</h4>

Turns an rgb color into an indexed color.  If <i>c</i> is already an
indexed color it is returned unchanged.  Otherwise, the closest color
from the color cube is returned.

<a name=set_color>
<h4>void fltk::set_color(fltk::Color index, fltk::Color v);</h4>

Set entry <i>index</i> in the fltk colormap to the rgb values of
<i>v</i>.  <i>index</i> must be in the range 1-31.

<a name=free_color>
<h4>void fltk::free_color(fltk::Color index);</h4>

Tell a colormapped-display that we don't need this indexed color
anymore.  Fltk will free any hardware colormap it allocated so that it
can be reused by this or another program.

<h4><a name=background>void fltk::background(fltk::Color)</h4>

Modifies the "gray ramp" in the fltk color map so that the color
<code>fltk::GRAY</code> is set the the rgb values of the passed color.
This is the best way to change the overall color of your application,
because it sets all the shaded borders and works on 8-bit screens.
