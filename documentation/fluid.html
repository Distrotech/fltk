<h2>What is Fluid?</h2>

<p>Fluid (the Fast Light User Interface Designer) is a graphical
editor that is used to produce fltk source code.

<p>Fluid edits and saves it's state in ".fl" files.  These files are
text, and you could (with care) edit them in a text editor, perhaps to
get some special effects.

<p>Fluid can "compile" the .fl file into a .C and a .H file.  The .C
file defines all the objects from the .fl file and the .H file
declares all the global ones.

<p>A simple program can be made by putting all your code (including a
main() function) into the .fl file and thus making the .C file a
single source file to compile.  Normally though you write other .C
files that call the fluid functions.  These .C files must #include the
.H file output (or they can #include the .C file so it still appears
to make to be a single source file).

<pre>

                            /________/                 /_________/
</pre>

<p>Normally the fluid file defines one or more "functions", which
output C++ functions.  Each function defines a one or more fltk
windows, and all the widgets that go inside those windows.

<p>Widgets created by fluid are either "named", "complex named" or
"unnamed".  A named widget has a legal C++ variable identifier as it's
name (ie only alphanumeric and underscore).  In this case fluid
defines a global variable that will point at the widget after the
function defining it is called.  A "complex named" object has
punctuation such as '.' or '->' or any other symbols in it's name.  In
this case fluid assigns a pointer to the widget to the name, but does
not attempt to declare it.  This can be used to get the widgets into
structures.  An "unnamed" widget has a blank name and no pointer to
them is stored.

<p>Widgets may either call a named callback function that you write in
another source file, or you can supply a small piece of C++ source and
fluid will write a private callback function into the .C file.

<h2>Worlds shortest tutorial</h2>

<ol>

<li>Type "fluid&"

<li>Pick "New/code/function" off the menu.

<li>Hit Tab, Delete to delete the function name and hit OK.  This is
how you get fluid to output a "main()" function.  The text "main()"
with a triangle next to it should appear highlighted in the main
window.

<li>Pick "New/group/Window" off the menu.

<li>Move the new window and resize it to the size you want.

<li>Pick "New/buttons/Button" off the menu.

<li>Hit the "OK" button to dismiss the panel that appears.

<li>In the window you created, try moving the button by dragging it
around.  Notice that it "snaps" to fixed locations.  If you want to
drag it smoothly, hold down Alt.  You can also change the size of the
steps with Edit/Preferences.

<li>Try resizing the widget by dragging the edges and corners.

<li>Type Alt+c to copy the widget.

<li>Type Alt+v to paste a copy into the window.

<li>Type Alt+v several times.

<li>Drag the widgets and resize them so they don't overlap.  Notice
that you have to click a widget to pick it first, then drag it.

<li>Try selecting several widgets by dragging a box around them.  Check
what happens when you move them, or when you drag an edge to resize
them.

<li>You can also use Shift+click to toggle widgets on and off.

<li>You can also select widgets by clicking on them in the list in the
main window, try that.

<li>Double-click one of the widgets.  You will get a control panel.

<li>Try changing the "label".  Try changing other items near the top of
the panel.  To see any changes to the box type clearer, type "Alt+o"
to make the red overlay disappear.

<li>Type "#include &lt;stdlib.h>" into the first line of "extra code:".

<li>Type "exit(0);" into the "callback:".

<li>Hit OK.

<li>Pick "File/Save As" off the menu.

<li>Type "test.fl" into the file chooser and hit return.

<li>Pick "File/Write Code" off the menu, hit OK on the confirmation panel.

<li>Go back to your terminal window.  Type "more test.C" and "more
test.H" and you can see the code it made.  Also try "more test.fl" to
see how fluid saves it's data.

<li>Type "make test" (you may have to add libaries to your Makefile).

<li>Type "./test" to run your program.

<li>Try the buttons.  The one you put the code into will exit the
program.

<li>Type "Alt+Q" to exit fluid.

<li>Ok, now try to make a real program.

</ol>

<a name=running>
<h2>Running fluid</h2>

<p>Type

<pre>
	fluid &lt;name>.fl &
</pre>

<p>to edit the .fl file &lt;name>.fl.  If the file does not exist you
will get an error pop-up, but if you dismiss it you will be editing a
blank setup of that name.  You can run fluid without any name, in
which case you will be editing an unnamed blank setup (but you can use
save-as to write it to a file).

<p>You can provide any of the standard fltk switches before the name:

<pre>
	 -display host:n.n
	 -geometry WxH+X+Y
	 -title windowtitle
	 -name classname
	 -iconic
	 -fg color
	 -bg color
	 -bg2 color
</pre>

<p>Changing the colors may be useful to see what your interface will
look at if the user calls it with the same switches.

<p>In the current version, if you don't go into the background (with
'&') then you will be able to abort fluid by typing ^C on the terminal.
It will exit immediately, losing any changes.

<a name=compiling>
<h2>Compiling .fl files</h2>

<p>Fluid can also be called as a command-line "compiler" to create the
.C and .H file from a .fl file.  To do this type

<pre>
	fluid -c &lt;name>.fl
</pre>

<p>This will read the .fl file and write &lt;name>.C and
&lt;name>.H (the directory will be stripped, they are written to the
current directory always), and then exit.  If there are any errors
reading or writing the files it will print the error and exit with a
non-zero code.  This is useful in a makefile.  A line like this will
work:

<pre>
my_panels.H my_panels.C : my_panels.fl
	fluid -c my_panels.fl
</pre>

<p>Some versions of Make will accept rules like this to allow all .fl
files found to be compiled:

<pre>
.SUFFIXES : .fl .C .H
.fl.H :
	fluid -c $&lt;
.fl.C :
	fluid -c $&lt;
</pre>

<p>Some versions of Make (gnumake) may prefer this syntax:

<pre>
%.H: %.fl
        fluid -c $&lt;

%.C: %.fl
        fluid -c $&lt;
</pre>

<a name=browser>
<h2>The Widget Browser</h2>

<p><img src=fluid_main.gif align = left>

<p>The main window shows a menu bar and a scrolling browser of all the
defined widgets.  The name of the .fl file being edited is shown in
the window title.

<p>The widgets are stored in a hierarchy.  You can open and close a
level by clicking the "triangle" at the left of a widget.  This
widget is the <i>parent</i>, and all the widgets listed below it are it's
<i>children</i>.  There can be zero children.

<p>The top level of the hierarchy is <i>functions</i>.  Each of these
will produce a single C++ public function in the output .C file.
Calling the function will create all of it's child windows.

<p>The second level of the hierarchy is <i>windows</i>.  Each of these
produces an instance of class Fl_Window.

<p>Below that are either <i>widgets</i> (subclasses of Fl_Widget) or
<i>groups</i> of widgets (including other groups).  Plain groups are
for layout, navigation, and resize purposes.  <i>Tab groups</i>
provide the well-known file-card tab interface.

<p>Widgets are shown in the browser as either their <i>name</i> (such
as "main_panel" in the example), or if <i>unnamed</i> as their
<i>type</i> and <i>label</i> (such as "Button "the green"").

<p>You <i>select</i> widgets by clicking on their names, which
highlights them (you can also select widgets from any displayed
window).  You can select many widgets by dragging the mouse across
them, or by using shift+click to toggle them on and off.  To select no
widgets, click in the blank area under the last widget.  Notice that
hidden children may be selected and there is no visual indication of
this.

<p>You <i>open</i> widgets by double clicking them, or (to open several
widgets you have picked) by typing the F1 key.  This will bring up a
control panel or window from which you can change the widget.

<a name=menu>
<h2>Menu Items</h2>

<p>The menu bar at the top is duplicated as a pop-up menu on any
displayed window.  The shortcuts for all the menu items work in any
window.  The menu items are:

</ul><h4>File/Open... (Alt+Shift+O)</h4><ul>

Discard the current editing session and read in a different .fl file.
You are asked for confirmation if you have changed the current data.

<p>fluid can also read .fd files produced by the Forms and XForms
"fdesign" programs.  It is best to read them with Merge.  Fluid does not
understand everything in a .fd file, and will print a warning message
on the controlling terminal for all data it does not understand.  You
will probably need to edit the resulting setup to fix these errors.
Be careful not to save the file without changing the name, as fluid
will write over the .fd file with it's own format, which fdesign
cannot read!

</ul><h4>File/Save (Alt+s)</h4><ul>

Write the current data to the .fl file.  If the file is unnamed
(because fluid was started with no name) then ask for a file name.

</ul><h4>File/Save As...(Alt+Shift+S)</h4><ul>

Ask for a new name to save the file as, and save it.

</ul><h4>File/Merge... (Alt+i)</h4><ul>

Insert the contents of another .fl file, without changing the name of
the current .fl file.  All the functions (even if they have the same
names as the current ones) are added, you will have to use cut/paste
to put the widgets where you want.

</ul><h4>File/Write code (Alt+Shift+C)</h4><ul>

"Compiles" the data into a .C and .H file.  These are exactly the same
as the files you get when you run fluid with the -c switch.

<p>The output file names are the same as the .fl file, with the
leading directory and trailing ".fl" stripped, and ".H" or ".C"
appended.  Currently there is no way to override this.

</ul><h4>File/Quit (Alt+q)</h4><ul>

Exit fluid.  You are asked for confirmation if you have changed the
current data.

</ul><h4>Edit/Undo (Alt+z)</h4><ul>

Don't you wish...  This isn't implemented yet.  You should do save
often so that any mistakes you make don't irretrivably destroy your
data.

</ul><h4>Edit/Cut (Alt+x)</h4><ul>

Delete the selected widgets and all their children.  These are saved
to a "clipboard" file (/usr/tmp/cut_buffer.fl) and can be pasted back
into this fluid or any other one.

</ul><h4>Edit/Copy (Alt+c)</h4><ul>

Copy the selected widgets and all their children to the "clipboard" file.

</ul><h4>Edit/Paste (Alt+c)</h4><ul>

Paste in the widgets in the clipboard file.

<p>If the widget is a window, it is added to whatever function is
selected, or contains the current selection.

<p>If the widget is a normal widget, it is added to whatever window or
group is selected.  If none is, it is added to the window or group
that is the parent of the current selection.

<p>To avoid confusion, it is best to select exactly one widget before
doing a paste.

<p>Cut/paste is the only way to change the parent of a widget.

</ul><h4>Edit/Select All (Alt+a)</h4><ul>

Select all widgets in the same group as the current selection.

<p>If they are all selected already then this selects all widgets in
that group's parent.  Repeatedly typing Alt+a will select larger and
larger groups of widgets until everything is selected.

</ul><h4>Edit/Open... (F1 or double click)</h4><ul>

If the current widget is a window and it is not displayed, display it.
Otherwise open a control panel for the most recent (and possibly all)
selected widgets.

</ul><h4>Edit/Sort</h4><ul>

All the selected widgets are sorted into left to right, top to bottom
order.  You need to do this to make navigation keys in fltk work
correctly.  You may then fine-tune the sorting with "Earlier" and
"Later".  This does not affect the positions of windows or functions.

</ul><h4>Edit/Earlier (F2)</h4><ul>

All the selected widgets are moved one earlier in order amoung the
children of their parent (if possible).  This will affect navigation
order, and if the widgets overlap it will affect how they draw, as the
later widget is drawn on top of the earlier one.  You can also use
this to reorder functions and windows within functions.

</ul><h4>Edit/Later (F3)</h4><ul>

All the selected widgets are moved one later in order amoung the
children of their parent (if possible).

</ul><h4>Edit/Group (F7)</h4><ul>

Create a new Fl_Group and make all the currently selected widgets be
children of it.

</ul><h4>Edit/Ungroup (F8)</h4><ul>

If all the children of a group are selected, delete that group and
make them all be children of it's parent.

</ul><h4>Edit/Overlays on/off (Alt+o)</h4><ul>

Toggle the display of the red overlays off, without changing the
selection.  This makes it easier to see box borders and how the layout
looks.  The overlays will be forced back on if you change the selection.

</ul><h4>Edit/Preferences (Alt+p)</h4><ul>

Currently the only preferences are for the "alignment grid" that all
widgets snap to when you move them and resize them, and for the "snap"
which is how far a widget has to be dragged from it's original
position to actually change.

</ul><h4>New/code/Function</h4><ul>

Create a new C function.  You will be asked for a name for the
function.  This name should be a legal C++ function template, without
the return type.  You can pass arguments, they can be referred to by
code you type into the individual widgets.

<p>If the function contains any unnamed windows, it will be declared
as returning an Fl_Window*.  The unnamed window will be returned from
it (more than one unnamed window is useless).  If the function
contains only named windows it will be declared as returning void.

<p>It is possible to make the .C output be a self-contained program
that can be compiled and executed.  This is done by deleting the
function name, in which case "main(argc,argv)" is used.  The function
will call show() on all the windows it creates and then call
Fl::run().  This can be used to test resize behavior or other parts of
the user interface.  I'm not sure if it is possible to create really
useful programs using just Fluid.

<p>You can change the function name by double clicking the function.

</ul><h4>New/Window</h4><ul>

Create a new Fl_Window.  It is added to the currently selected
function, or to the function containing the currently selected item.
The window will appear, sized to 100x100.  You will want to resize it
to whatever size you require.

<p>You also get the window's control panel, which is almost exactly
the same as any other Fl_Widget, and is described in the next chapter.

</ul><h4>New/...</h4><ul>

All other items on the New menu are subclasses of Fl_Widget.  Creating
them will add them to the currently selected group or window, or the
group or window containing the currently selected widget.  The initial
dimensions and position are chosen by copying the current widget, if
possible.

<p>When you create the widget you will get the widget's control panel,
described in the next chapter.

</ul><h4>Help/About fluid</h4><ul>

Pops up a panel showing the version of fluid.

</ul><h4>Help/Manual</h4><ul>

Not yet implemented.  Use netscape to read these pages instead.

</ul>

<a name=widget_panel>
<h2>The Widget Panel</h2>

When you double-click a widget or a set of widgets you will get the
"widget attribute panel":

<p><img align = left src = fluid_widget.gif>

<p>When you change attributes
using this panel, the changes are reflected immediately in the window.
It is useful to hit the "no&nbspoverlay" button (or type Alt+o) to
hide the red overlay so you can see the widgets more accurately,
especially when setting the box type.

<p>If you have several widgets selected, they may have different
values for the fields.  In this case the value for <i>one</i> of the
widgets is shown.  But if you change this value, <i>all</i> the
selected widgets are changed to the new value.

<p>Hitting "OK" makes the changes permanent.  Selecting a different
widget also makes the changes permanent.  Fluid checks for simple
syntax errors in any code (such as mismatched parenthesis) before
saving any text.

<p>"Revert" or "Cancel" put everything back to when you last brought
up the panel or hit OK.  However in the current version of Fluid,
changes to "visible" attributes (such as the color, label, box) are
not undone by revert or cancel.  Changes to code like the callbacks
is undone, however.

<a name=widget_attributes>
<h2>Widget Attributes</h2>

</ul><h4>Name (text field)</h4><ul>

Name of a global C variable to declare, and to store a pointer to this
widget into.  This variable will be of type "&lt;class>*".  If the name
is blank then no variable is created.

<p>You can name several widgets with "name[0]", "name[1]", "name[2]",
etc.  This will cause Fluid to declare an array of pointers.  The
array is big enough that the highest number found can be stored.  All
widgets that in the array must be the same type.

</ul><h4>Type (upper-right pulldown menu)</h4><ul>

Some classes have subtypes that modify their appearance or behavior.
You pick the subtype off of this menu.

</ul><h4>Box (pulldown menu)</h4><ul>

The boxtype to draw as a background for the widget.

<p>Many widgets will work, and draw faster, with a "frame" instead of
a "box".  A frame does not draw the colored interior, leaving whatever
was already there visible.  Be careful, as fluid may draw this ok but
the real program leave unwanted stuff inside the widget.

<p>If a window is filled with child widgets, you can speed up
redrawing by changing the window's box type to "NO_BOX".  Fluid will
display a checkerboard for any areas that are not colored in by boxes
(notice that this checkerboard is not drawn by the resulting program,
instead random garbage is left there).

</ul><h4>Color</h4><ul>

<p>The color to draw the box with.

</ul><h4>Color2</h4><ul>

<p>Some widgets will use this color for certain parts.  Fluid does not
always show the result of this: this is the color buttons draw in when
pushed down, and the color of input fields when they have the focus.

</ul><h4>Label</h4><ul>

String to print next to or inside the button.

<p>You can put newlines into the string to make multiple lines, the
easiest way is by typing ctrl+j.

</ul><h4>Label style (pull down menu)</h4><ul>

How to draw the label.  Normal, shadowned, engraved, and embossed
change the appearance of the text.  "symbol" requires the label to
start with an '@' sign to draw a named <a
href=Labeltypes.html#symbols>symbol</a>.

<p>From this menu you can also pick <a
href=#images>"Image..."</a>.  This lets you use the contents
of an image file (currently an xpm pixmap or xbm bitmap) to label the
widget.

</ul><h4>Label alignement (buttons)</h4><ul>

Where to draw the label.  The arrows put it on that side of the
widget, you can combine the to put it in the corner.  The "box" button
puts the label inside the widget, rather than outside.

</ul><h4>Label font</h4><ul>

Font to draw the label in.  Ignored by symbols, bitmaps, and pixmaps.
Your program can change the actual font used by these "slots", in case
you want some font other than the 16 provided.

</ul><h4>Label size</h4><ul>

Point size for the font to draw the label in.  Ignored by symbols,
bitmaps, and pixmaps.  To see the result without dismissing the panel,
type the new number and then Tab.

</ul><h4>Label color</h4><ul>

Color to draw the label.  Ignored by pixmaps (bitmaps, however, do use
this color as the foreground color).

</ul><h4>Text font, size, color</h4><ul>

Some widgets display text, such as input fields, pull-down menus,
browsers.  You can change this here.

</ul><h4>Visible</h4><ul>

If you turn this off the widget is hidden initially.  Don't change
this for windows or for the immediate children of a Tabs group.

</ul><h4>Active</h4><ul>

If you turn this off the widget is deactivated initially.  Currently
no fltk widgets display the fact that they are inactive (like by graying
out), but this may change in the future.

</ul><h4>Resizable</h4><ul>

If a window is resizable or has an immediate child that is resizable,
then the user will be able to resize it.  In addition all the size
changes of a window or group will go "into" the resizable child.  If
you have a large data display surrounded by buttons, you probably want
that data area to be resizable.

<p>Only one child can be resizable.  Turning this on turns it off for
other children.

<p>You can get more complex behavior by making invisible boxes the
resizable widget, or by using hierarchies of groups.  Unfortunatley
the only way to test it is to compile the program.  Resizing the fluid
window is <i>not</i> the same as what will happen in the user program.

</ul><h4>Hotspot</h4><ul>

Each window may have exactly one hotspot (turning this on will turn
off any others).  This will cause it to be positioned with that widget
centered on the mouse.  This position is determined <i>when the fluid
function is called, so you should call it immediately before showing
the window</i>.  If you want the window to hide and then reappear at a
new position, you should have your program set the hotspot itself just
before show().

</ul><h4>subclass</h4><ul>

This is how you put your own subclasses of Fl_Widget in.  Whatever
identifier you type in here will be the class that is instantiated.

<p>In addition, no #include header file is put in the .H file.  You
must provide a #include line as the first of the "extra&nbspcode" which
declares your subclass.

<p>The class had better be similar to the class you are spoofing.  It
does not have to be a subclass.  It is sometimes useful to change this
to another fltk class: currently the only way to get a double-buffered
window is to change this field for the window to "Fl_Double_Window"
and to add "#include &lt;FL/Fl_Double_Window.H>" to the extra code.

</ul><h4>Extra code</h4><ul>

These four fields let you type in literal lines of code to dump into
the .H or .C files.

<p>If the text starts with a '#' or the word "extern" then fluid
thinks this is an "include" line, and it is written to the .H file.
If the same include line occurs several times then only one copy is
written.

<p>All other lines are "code" lines.  The widget being constructed is
pointed to by the local variable 'o'.  The window being constructed is
pointed to by the local variable 'w'.  You can also access any
arguments passed to the function here, and any named widgets that are
before this one.

<p>Fluid will check for matching parenthesis, braces, and quotes, but
does not do much other error checking.  Be careful here, as it may be
hard to figure out what widget is producing an error in the compiler.
If you need more than 4 lines you probably should call a function in
your own .C code.

</ul><h4>Callback</h4><ul>

This can either be the name of a function, or a small snippet of
code.  Fluid thinks that if there is any punctuation then it is code.

<p>A name names a function in your own code.  It must be declared as
"void&nbsp&lt;name>(&lt;class>*,void*)".

<p>A code snippet is inserted into a static function in the .C output
file.  The function prototype is
"void&nbspf(&lt;class>*&nbspo,&nbspvoid*&nbspv)", so you can refer to
the widget as 'o' and the user_data as 'v'.  Fluid will check for
matching parenthesis, braces, and quotes, but does not do much other
error checking.  Be careful here, as it may be hard to figure out what
widget is producing an error in the compiler.

<p>If the callback is blank then no callback is set.

</ul><h4>user_data</h4><ul>

<p>This is a value for the user_data() of the widget.  If blank the
default value of zero is used.  This can be any piece of C code that
can be put "(void*)(&lt;here>)".

</ul><h4>User data type</h4><ul>

The "void*" in the callback function prototypes is replaced with
this.  You may want to use "long" for old XForms code.  Be warned that
anything other than "void*" is not guaranteed to work by the C++ spec!
However on most architectures other pointer types are ok, and long is
usually ok.

</ul><h4>When</h4><ul>

When to do the callback.  Can be "never", "changed", "release".  The
value of "enter key" is only useful for text input fields.  The "no
change" button means the callback is done on the matching event even
if the data is not changed.

<p>There are rare but useful other values for the when() field that
are not in the menu.  You should use the extra code fields to put
these values in.

</ul>

<a name=windows>
<h2>Selecting & Moving Widgets</h2>

<p>Double-clicking a window name in the browser will display it, if
not displayed yet.  From this display you can select widgets, sets of
widgets, and move or resize them.  To close a window either
double-click it or type Esc.

<p>To select a widget, click it.  To select several widgets drag a
rectangle around them.  Holding down shift will toggle the selection
of the widgets instead.

<p>You cannot pick hidden widgets.  You also cannot choose some
widgets if they are completely overlapped by later widgets.  Use the
browser to select these widgets.

<p>The selected widgets are shown with a red "overlay" line around
them.  You can move the widgets by dragging this box.  Or you can
resize them by dragging the outer edges and corners.  Hold down the
Alt key while dragging the mouse to defeat the snap-to-grid effect for
fine positioning.

<p>If there is a tab box displayed you can change which child is
visible by clicking on the file tabs.  The child you pick is
selected.

<p>The arrow, tab, and shift+tab keys "navigate" the selection.  Left,
right, tab, or shift+tab move to the next or previous widgets in the
hierarchy.  Hit the right arrow enough and you will select every
widget in the window.  Up/down widgets move to the previous/next
widgets that overlap horizontally.  If the navigation does not seem to
work you probably need to "Sort" the widgets.  This is important if
you have input fields, as fltk uses the same rules when using arrow keys
to move between input fields.

<p>To "open" a widget, double click it.  To open several widgets
select them and then type F1 or pick "Edit/Open" off the pop-up menu.

<p>Type Alt+o to temporarily toggle the overlay off without changing
the selection, so you can see the widget borders.

<p>You can resize the window by using the window manager border
controls.  Fltk will attempt to round the window size to the nearest
multiple of the grid size and makes it big enough to contain all the
widgets (it does this using illegal X methods, so it is possible it
will barf with some window managers!).  Notice that the actual window
in your program may not be resizable, and if it is, the effect on
child widgets may be different.

<p>The panel for the window (which you get by double-clicking it) is
almost identical to the panel for any other Fl_Widget.  There are
three extra items:

</ul><h4>Border</h4><ul>

This button turns the window manager border on or off.  On most window
managers you will have to close the window and reopen it to see the
effect.

</ul><h4>xclass</h4><ul>

The string typed into here is passed to the X window manager as the
class.  This can change the icon or window decorations.  On most
(all?) window managers you will have to close the window and reopen it
to see the effect.

</ul>

<a name=images>
<h2>Image Labels</h2>

<p>Selecting "Image..." off the label style pull-down menu will bring
up a file chooser from which you pick the image file.  If an image has
already been chosen, you can change the image used by picking
"Image..." again.  The name of the image will appear in the "label"
field, but you can't edit it.

<p>The <i>contents</i> of the image file are written to the .C file,
so if you wish to distribute the C code, you only need to copy the .C
file, not the images.  If many widgets share the same image then only
one copy is written.

<p>However the <i>file name</i> is stored in the .fl file, so to read
the .fl file you need the image files as well.  Filenames are relative
to the location the .fl file is (not necessarily the current
directory).  I recommend you either put the images in the same
directory as the .fl file, or use absolute path names.

</ul><h4>Notes for all image types</h4><ul>

<p>Fluid runs using the default visual of your X server.  This may be
8 bits, which will give you dithered images.  You may get better
results in your actual program by adding the code "Fl::visual(FL_RGB)"
to your code right before the first window is displayed.

<p>All widgets with the same image on them share the same code and
source X pixmap.  Thus once you have put an image on a widget, it is
nearly free to put the same image on many other widgets.

<p>If you are using a painting program to edit an image: the only way
to convince Fluid to read the image file again is to remove the image
from all widgets that are using it (including ones in closed windows),
which will cause it to free it's internal copy, and then set the image
again.  You may find it easier to exit Fluid and run it again.

<p>Don't rely on how fltk crops images that are outside the widget, as
this may change in future versions!  The cropping of inside labels
will probably be unchanged.

<p>To more accurately place images, make a new "box" widget and put
the image in that as the label.  This is also how you can put both an
image and text label on the same widget.  If your widget is a button,
and you want the image inside it, you must change the button's boxtype
to FL_UP_FRAME (or another frame), otherwise when it is pushed it will
erase the image.

</ul><h4>XBM (X bitmap files)</h4><ul>

<p>Fluid will read X bitmap files.  These files have C source code to
define a bitmap.  Sometimes they are stored with the ".h" or ".bm"
extension rather than the standard ".xbm".

<p>Fluid will output code to construct an Fl_Bitmap widget and use it
to label the widget.  The '1' bits in the bitmap are drawn using the
label color of the widget.  You can change the color in Fluid.  The
'0' bits are transparent.

<p>The program "bitmap" on the X distribution does an ok job of
editing bitmaps.

</ul><h4>XPM (X pixmap files)</h4><ul>

<p>Fluid will read X pixmap files as used by the libxpm library.
These files have C source code to define a pixmap.  The filenames
usually have a ".xpm" extension.

<p>Fluid will output code to construct an Fl_Pixmap widget and use it
to label the widget.  The label color of the widget is ignored, even
for 2-color images that could be a bitmap.

<p>XPM files can mark a single color as being transparent.  Currently
fltk and Fluid simulate this transparency rather badly.  It will use the
color() of the widget as the background, and all widgets using the
same pixmap are assummed to have the same color.  This may be fixed in
the future or on non-X systems.

<p>I have not found any good editors for small iconic pictures.  For
pixmaps I have used <a
href=http://www.danbbs.dk/~torsten/xpaint/index.html>XPaint</a>.  This
(and most other) painting programs are designed for large full color
images and are difficult to use to edit an image of small size and few
colors.

</ul><h4>GIF files</h4><ul>

<p>Fluid will also read GIF image files.  These files are often used
on html documents to make icons.  This lets you use nice icons that
you steal off the net in your user interface.

<p>Fluid converts these into <a href=xpm.html>(modified)</a> xpm
format and uses an Fl_Pixmap widget to label the widget.  Transparency
is handled the same as for xpm files.  Notice that the conversion
removes the compression, so the code may be much bigger than the .gif
file.  Only the first image of an animated gif file is used.

<p>Behavior and performance with large .gif files is not guaranteed!
