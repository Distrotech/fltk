<H1 ALIGN=RIGHT><A NAME=FLUID>8 - Programming with FLUID</A></H1>
 This chapter shows how to use the Fast Light User-Interface Designer 
(&quot;FLUID&quot;) to create your GUIs. 
<H2>What is FLUID?</H2>
 The Fast Light User Interface Designer, or FLUID, is a graphical 
editor that is used to produce FLTK source code. 
<P>FLUID edits and saves its state in <TT>.fl</TT> files.  These files are 
text, and you can (with care) edit them in a text editor, perhaps to 
get some special effects. </P>
<P>FLUID can &quot;compile&quot; the <TT>.fl</TT> file into a <TT>.cxx</TT> and a <TT>.h</TT> file.  The 
<TT>.cxx</TT> file defines all the objects from the <TT>.fl</TT> file and the <TT>.h</TT> file 
declares all the global ones. </P>
<P>A simple program can be made by putting all your code (including a <TT>
main()</TT> function) into the <TT>.fl</TT> file and thus making the <TT>.cxx</TT> file a 
single source file to compile.  Most programs are more complex than 
this, so you write other <TT>.cxx</TT> files that call the FLUID functions. 
 These <TT>.cxx</TT> files must <TT>#include</TT> the <TT>.h</TT> file or they can <TT>
#include</TT> the <TT>.cxx</TT> file so it still appears to be a single source 
file. 
<CENTER><IMG src=./fluid-org.gif></CENTER>
</P>
<P>Normally the FLUID file defines one or more functions or classes which
output C++ code.  Each function defines a one or more FLTK 
windows, and all the widgets that go inside those windows. </P>
<P>Widgets created by FLUID are either &quot;named&quot;, &quot;complex named&quot; or 
&quot;unnamed&quot;.  A named widget has a legal C++ variable identifier as its 
name (i.e. only alphanumeric and underscore).  In this case FLUID 
defines a global variable or class member that will point at the widget 
after the function defining it is called.  A complex named object has 
punctuation such as '.' or '-&gt;' or any other symbols in its name.  In 
this case FLUID assigns a pointer to the widget to the name, but does 
not attempt to declare it.  This can be used to get the widgets into 
structures.  An unnamed widget has a blank name and no pointer is stored. </P>
<P>Widgets may either call a named callback function that you write in 
another source file, or you can supply a small piece of C++ source and 
FLUID will write a private callback function into the <TT>.cxx</TT> file. </P>
<H2>Running FLUID Under UNIX</H2>
 To run FLUID under UNIX, type: 
<UL>
<PRE>
fluid <I>filename.fl</I> &amp;</PRE>
</UL>
to edit the <TT>.fl</TT> file <TT>filename.fl</TT>.  If the file does not exist 
you will get an error pop-up, but if you dismiss it you will be editing 
a blank file of that name.  You can run FLUID without any name, in 
which case you will be editing an unnamed blank setup (but you can use 
save-as to write it to a file). 
<P>You can provide any of the standard FLTK switches before the filename: </P>
<UL>
<PRE>
-display host:n.n
-geometry WxH+X+Y
-title windowtitle
-name classname
-iconic
-fg color
-bg color
-bg2 color
</PRE>
</UL>
 Changing the colors may be useful to see what your interface will look 
at if the user calls it with the same switches. 
<P>In the current version, if you don't go into the background (with 
'&amp;' then you will be able to abort FLUID by typing ^C on the terminal. It 
will exit immediately, losing any changes. </P>
<H2>Running FLUID Under Microsoft Windows</H2>
To run FLUID under WIN32, double-click on the <I>fluid.exe</I> file. 
You can also run FLUID from the Command Prompt window (FLUID always 
runs in the background under WIN32). 
<H2>A Short Tutorial</H2>
<OL>
<LI>Type &quot;FLUID&quot; </LI>
<LI>Pick &quot;New/code/function&quot; off the menu. </LI>
<LI>Hit Tab, Delete to delete the function name and hit OK.  This is 
 how you get FLUID to output a &quot;main()&quot; function.  The text &quot;main()&quot; 
 with a triangle next to it should appear highlighted in the main 
 window. </LI>
<LI>Pick &quot;New/group/Window&quot; off the menu. </LI>
<LI>Move the new window and resize it to the size you want. </LI>
<LI>Pick &quot;New/buttons/Button&quot; off the menu. </LI>
<LI>Hit the &quot;OK&quot; button to dismiss the panel that appears. </LI>
<LI>In the window you created, try moving the button by dragging it 
 around.  Notice that it &quot;snaps&quot; to fixed locations.  If you want to 
 drag it smoothly, hold down Alt.  You can also change the size of the 
 steps with Edit/Preferences. </LI>
<LI>Try resizing the widget by dragging the edges and corners. </LI>
<LI>Type Alt+c to copy the widget. </LI>
<LI>Type Alt+v to paste a copy into the window. </LI>
<LI>Type Alt+v several times. </LI>
<LI>Drag the widgets and resize them so they don't overlap.  Notice 
 that you have to click a widget to pick it first, then drag it. </LI>
<LI>Try selecting several widgets by dragging a box around them.  Check 
 what happens when you move them, or when you drag an edge to resize 
 them. </LI>
<LI>You can also use Shift+click to toggle widgets on and off. </LI>
<LI>You can also select widgets by clicking on them in the list in the 
 main window, try that. </LI>
<LI>Double-click one of the widgets.  You will get a control panel. </LI>
<LI>Try changing the &quot;label&quot;.  Try changing other items near the top of 
 the panel.  To see any changes to the box type clearer, type &quot;Alt+o&quot; 
 to make the red overlay disappear. </LI>
<LI>Type &quot;#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;&quot; into the first line of &quot;extra code:&quot;. </LI>
<LI>Type &quot;exit(0);&quot; into the &quot;callback:&quot;. </LI>
<LI>Hit OK. </LI>
<LI>Pick &quot;File/Save As&quot; off the menu. </LI>
<LI>Type &quot;test.fl&quot; into the file chooser and hit return. </LI>
<LI>Pick &quot;File/Write Code&quot; off the menu, hit OK on the confirmation 
panel. </LI>
<LI>Go back to your terminal window.  Type &quot;more test.cxx&quot; and &quot;more 
 test.h&quot; and you can see the code it made.  Also try &quot;more test.fl&quot; to 
 see how FLUID saves its data. </LI>
<LI>Type &quot;make test&quot; (you may have to add libaries to your Makefile). </LI>
<LI>Type &quot;./test&quot; to run your program. </LI>
<LI>Try the buttons.  The one you put the code into will exit the 
 program. </LI>
<LI>Type &quot;Alt+Q&quot; to exit FLUID. </LI>
<LI>Ok, now try to make a real program. </LI>
</OL>
<H2>Compiling <TT>.fl</TT> files</H2>
 FLUID can also be called as a command-line &quot;compiler&quot; to create the 
<TT>.cxx</TT> and <TT>.h</TT> file from a <TT>.fl</TT> file.  To do this type: 
<UL><PRE>
FLUID -c <I>filename.fl</I>
</PRE></UL>
This will read the <TT>filename.fl</TT> file and write <I>filename.cxx</I> and <I>
filename.h</I>. The directory will be stripped, so they are written to 
the current directory always.  If there are any errors reading or 
writing the files it will print the error and exit with a non-zero 
code.  In a makefile you can use a line like this:
<UL>
<PRE>
my_panels.h my_panels.cxx: my_panels.fl
	fluid -c my_panels.fl
</PRE>
</UL>
 Some versions of make will accept rules like this to allow all <TT>.fl</TT> 
files found to be compiled: 
<UL>
<PRE>
.SUFFIXES: .fl .cxx .h
.fl.h .fl.cxx:
	fluid -c $&lt;
</PRE>
</UL>
<H2>The Widget Browser</H2>
<TABLE cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0>
<TR><TD>The main window shows a menu bar and a scrolling browser of all 
the defined widgets.  The name of the <TT>.fl</TT> file being edited is shown in 
the window title. 
<P>The widgets are stored in a hierarchy.  You can open and close a 
level by clicking the &quot;triangle&quot; at the left of a widget. 
The leftmost widgets are the <I>parents</I>, and all the widgets
listed below them are their <I>children</I>.  Parents don't have to have
any children.</P>
<P>The top level of the hierarchy is composed of <I>functions</I> and
<I>classes</I>.  Each of these will produce a single C++ public
function or class in the output <TT>.cxx</TT> file.  Calling the function or
instantiating the class will create all of the child widgets. </P>
<P>The second level of the hierarchy contains the <I>windows</I>.  Each of these 
produces an instance of class <tt>Fl_Window</tt>. </P>
<P>Below that are either <I>widgets</I> (subclasses of <tt>Fl_Widget</tt>) or <I>
groups</I> of widgets (including other groups).  Plain groups are for 
layout, navigation, and resize purposes. <I>Tab groups</I> provide the 
well-known file-card tab interface. </P>
<P>Widgets are shown in the browser by either their <I>name</I> (such 
as &quot;main_panel&quot; in the example), or by their <I>type</I>
and <I>label</I> (such as &quot;Button &quot;the green&quot;&quot;). </P>
</TD><TD><IMG src=./fluid_main.gif width=245></TD></TR>
</TABLE>
 You <I>select</I> widgets by clicking on their names, which highlights 
them (you can also select widgets from any displayed window).  You can 
select many widgets by dragging the mouse across them, or by using 
Shift+Click to toggle them on and off.  To select no widgets, click in 
the blank area under the last widget.  Note that hidden children may 
be selected even when there is no visual indication of this. 
<P>You <I>open</I> widgets by double-clicking on them, or (to open several 
widgets you have picked) by typing the F1 key.  A control panel will appear
so you can change the widget(s).</P>
<H2>Menu Items</H2>
<P>The menu bar at the top is duplicated as a pop-up menu on any 
displayed window.  The shortcuts for all the menu items work in any 
window.  The menu items are: </P>
<H3>File/Open... (Alt+o)</H3>
Discards the current editing session and reads in a different <TT>.fl</TT> file. 
You are asked for confirmation if you have changed the current file.
<P>FLUID can also read <tt>.fd</tt> files produced by the Forms and
XForms &quot;fdesign&quot; programs. It is best to File/Merge them
instead of opening them. FLUID does not understand everything in a
<tt>.fd</tt> file, and will print a warning message on the controlling
terminal for all data it does not understand. You will probably need
to edit the resulting setup to fix these errors. Be careful not to
save the file without changing the name, as FLUID will write over the
<tt>.fd</tt> file with its own format, which fdesign cannot read! </P>
<H3>File/Save (Alt+s)</H3>
Writes the current data to the <TT>.fl</TT> file.  If the file is unnamed 
then FLUID will ask for a filename. 
<H3>File/Save As...(Alt+Shift+S)</H3>
Asks for a new filename and saves the file.
<H3>File/Merge... (Alt+i)</H3>
Inserts the contents of another <TT>.fl</TT> file, without changing the name of 
the current <TT>.fl</TT> file.  All the functions (even if they have the same 
names as the current ones) are added, and you will have to use cut/paste to 
put the widgets where you want. 
<H3>File/Write Code (Alt+Shift+C)</H3>
&quot;Compiles&quot; the data into a <TT>.cxx</TT> and <TT>.h</TT>
file. These are exactly the same as the files you get when you run
FLUID with the <tt>-c</tt> switch. 
<P>The output file names are the same as the <TT>.fl</TT> file, with
the leading  directory and trailing &quot;.fl&quot; stripped, and
&quot;.h&quot; or &quot;.cxx&quot; appended.  </P>
<H3>File/Quit (Alt+q)</H3>
Exits FLUID.  You are asked for confirmation if you have changed the 
current data. 
<H3>Edit/Undo (Alt+z)</H3>
This isn't implemented yet.  You should do save  often so you can
recover from any mistakes you make. 
<H3>Edit/Cut (Alt+x)</H3>
Deletes the selected widgets and all of their children.  These are saved 
to a &quot;clipboard&quot; file and can be pasted back into any FLUID
window.
<H3>Edit/Copy (Alt+c)</H3>
Copies the selected widgets and all of their children to the &quot;clipboard&quot; 
file. 
<H3>Edit/Paste (Alt+c)</H3>
Pastes the widgets from the clipboard file. 
<P>If the widget is a window, it is added to whatever function is 
selected, or contained in the current selection. </P>
<P>If the widget is a normal widget, it is added to whatever window or 
group is selected.  If none is, it is added to the window or group that 
is the parent of the current selection. </P>
<P>To avoid confusion, it is best to select exactly one widget before 
doing a paste. </P>
<P>Cut/paste is the only way to change the parent of a widget. </P>
<H3>Edit/Select All (Alt+a)</H3>
Selects all widgets in the same group as the current selection. 
<P>If they are all selected already then this selects all widgets in 
that group's parent.  Repeatedly typing Alt+a will select larger and 
larger groups of widgets until everything is selected. </P>
<H3>Edit/Open... (F1 or double click)</H3>
Displays the current widget in the attributes panel. If the widget is a window
and it is not visible then the window is shown instead.
<H3>Edit/Sort</H3>
Sorts the selected widgets into left to right, top to bottom 
order.  You need to do this to make navigation keys in FLTK work 
correctly.  You may then fine-tune the sorting with &quot;Earlier&quot; and 
&quot;Later&quot;.  This does not affect the positions of windows or functions. 
<H3>Edit/Earlier (F2)</H3>
Moves all of the selected widgets one earlier in order among the 
children of their parent (if possible).  This will affect navigation 
order, and if the widgets overlap it will affect how they draw, as the 
later widget is drawn on top of the earlier one.  You can also use this 
to reorder functions, classes, and windows within functions. 
<H3>Edit/Later (F3)</H3>
Moves all of the selected widgets one later in order among the 
children of their parent (if possible). 
<H3>Edit/Group (F7)</H3>
Creates a new <tt>Fl_Group</tt> and make all the currently selected widgets
children of it. 
<H3>Edit/Ungroup (F8)</H3>
Deletes the parent group if all the children of a group are selected.
<H3>Edit/Overlays on/off (Alt+Shift+O)</H3>
Toggles the display of the red overlays off, without changing the 
selection.  This makes it easier to see box borders and how the layout 
looks.  The overlays will be forced back on if you change the 
selection. 
<H3>Edit/Preferences (Alt+p)</H3>
<TABLE WIDTH=100%>
<TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP>
Displays the preferences panel.  The alignment preferences control the
grid that all widgets snap to when you move and resize them, and for the
"snap" which is how far a widget has to be dragged from its original position 
to actually change.

<P>The output filenames control the extensions or names of the files the are
generated by FLUID.  If you check the "Include .h from .cxx" button the code
file will include the header file automatically.
</TD>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><IMG SRC="fluid_prefs.gif"></TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>

<H3>New/Code/Function</H3>
Creates a new C function.  You will be asked for a name for the 
function.  This name should be a legal C++ function template, without 
the return type.  You can pass arguments which can be referred to by 
code you type into the individual widgets. 
<P>If the function contains any unnamed windows, it will be declared
as  returning a Fl_Window pointer.  The unnamed window will be returned
from it  (more than one unnamed window is useless).  If the function
contains  only named windows, it will be declared as returning nothing
(<tt>void</tt>). </P>
<P>It is possible to make the <TT>.cxx</TT> output be a self-contained
program  that can be compiled and executed.  This is done by deleting
the  function name so <tt>main(argc,argv)</tt> is used.  The function 
will call <tt>show()</tt> on all the windows it creates and then call
<tt>Fl::run()</tt>.  This can also be used to test resize behavior or
other parts of the user  interface.</P>
<P>You can change the function name by double-clicking on the function. </P>
<H3>New/Window</H3>
Creates a new <tt>Fl_Window</tt> widget.  The window is added to the
currently selected  function, or to the function containing the
currently selected item.  The window will appear, sized to 100x100. 
You can resize it to whatever size you require. 
<P>The widget panel will also appear and is described later in this
chapter.</P>
<H3>New/...</H3>
All other items on the New menu are subclasses of <tt>Fl_Widget</tt>.  Creating 
them will add them to the currently selected group or window, or the 
group or window containing the currently selected widget.  The initial 
dimensions and position are chosen by copying the current widget, if 
possible. 
<P>When you create the widget you will get the widget's control panel, 
which is described later in this chapter. </P>
<H3>Help/About FLUID</H3>
Pops up a panel showing the version of FLUID. 
<H2>The Widget Panel</H2>
<TABLE cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0>
<TR><TD>When you double-click on a widget or a set of widgets you will get 
the &quot;widget attribute panel&quot;. 
<P>When you change attributes using this panel, the changes are 
reflected immediately in the window. It is useful to hit the &quot;no 
overlay&quot; button (or type Alt+Shift+O) to hide the red overlay so you can see 
the widgets more accurately, especially when setting the box type. </P>
<P>If you have several widgets selected, they may have different values 
for the fields.  In this case the value for <I>one</I> of the widgets 
is shown.  But if you change this value, <I>all</I> of the selected 
widgets are changed to the new value. </P>
<P>Hitting &quot;OK&quot; makes the changes permanent.  Selecting a different 
widget also makes the changes permanent.  FLUID checks for simple 
syntax errors such as mismatched parenthesis in any code before 
saving any text. </P>
</TD><TD><IMG src=./fluid_widget.gif width=225></TD></TR>
</TABLE>
&quot;Revert&quot; or &quot;Cancel&quot; put everything back to when you last brought up 
the panel or hit OK.  However in the current version of FLUID, changes 
to &quot;visible&quot; attributes (such as the color, label, box) are not undone 
by revert or cancel.  Changes to code like the callbacks are undone, 
however.
<H2><A name=widget_attributes>Widget Attributes</A></H2>
<H3>Name (text field)</H3>
Name of a variable to declare, and to store a pointer to this 
widget into.  This variable will be of type &quot;&lt;class&gt;*&quot;.  If the name is 
blank then no variable is created. 
<P>You can name several widgets with &quot;name[0]&quot;, &quot;name[1]&quot;, &quot;name[2]&quot;, 
etc.  This will cause FLUID to declare an array of pointers.  The array 
is big enough that the highest number found can be stored.  All widgets 
that in the array must be the same type. </P>
<H3>Type (upper-right pulldown menu)</H3>
 Some classes have subtypes that modify their appearance or behavior. 
You pick the subtype off of this menu. 
<H3>Box (pulldown menu)</H3>
 The boxtype to draw as a background for the widget. 
<P>Many widgets will work, and draw faster, with a &quot;frame&quot; instead of a 
&quot;box&quot;.  A frame does not draw the colored interior, leaving whatever 
was already there visible.  Be careful, as FLUID may draw this ok but 
the real program may leave unwanted stuff inside the widget. </P>
<P>If a window is filled with child widgets, you can speed up redrawing 
by changing the window's box type to &quot;NO_BOX&quot;.  FLUID will display a 
checkerboard for any areas that are not colored in by boxes. Note 
that this checkerboard is not drawn by the resulting program. Instead 
random garbage will be displayed.</P>
<H3>Color</H3>
<P>The color to draw the box with. </P>
<H3>Color2</H3>
<P>Some widgets will use this color for certain parts.  FLUID does not 
always show the result of this: this is the color buttons draw in when 
pushed down, and the color of input fields when they have the focus. </P>
<H3>Label</H3>
 String to print next to or inside the button. 
<P>You can put newlines into the string to make multiple lines. The 
easiest way is by typing Ctrl+j. </P>
<H3>Label style (pull down menu)</H3>
 How to draw the label.  Normal, shadowed, engraved, and embossed 
change the appearance of the text.  &quot;symbol&quot; requires the label to 
start with an '@' sign to draw a named <A href=Labeltypes.html#symbols>
symbol</A>. 
<P>From this menu you can also pick <A href=drawing.html#images>
&quot;Image...&quot;</A>.  This lets you use the contents of a GIF, XPM, or
XBM image file to label the widget. </P>
<H3>Label Alignment (Buttons)</H3>
 Where to draw the label.  The arrows put it on that side of the 
widget, you can combine the to put it in the corner.  The &quot;box&quot; button 
puts the label inside the widget, rather than outside. 
<H3>Label Font</H3>
 Font to draw the label in.  Ignored by symbols, bitmaps, and pixmaps. 
Your program can change the actual font used by these &quot;slots&quot; in case 
you want some font other than the 16 provided. 
<H3>Label Size</H3>
Pixel size (height) for the font to draw the label in.  Ignored by symbols, 
bitmaps, and pixmaps.  To see the result without dismissing the panel, 
type the new number and then Tab. 
<H3>Label Color</H3>
Color to draw the label.  Ignored by pixmaps (bitmaps, however, do use 
this color as the foreground color). 
<H3>Text Font, Size, and Color</H3>
Some widgets display text, such as input fields, pull-down menus, and
browsers.
<H3>Visible</H3>
If you turn this off then the widget is hidden initially.  Don't change 
this for windows or for the immediate children of a Tabs group. 
<H3>Active</H3>
If you turn this off then the widget is deactivated initially.
<H3>Resizable</H3>
If a window is resizable or has an immediate child that is resizable, 
then the user will be able to resize it.  In addition all the size 
changes of a window or group will go &quot;into&quot; the resizable child.  If 
you have a large data display surrounded by buttons, you probably want 
that data area to be resizable. 
<P>Only one child can be resizable.  Turning this on turns it off for 
the other children. </P>
<P>You can get more complex behavior by making invisible boxes the 
resizable widget, or by using hierarchies of groups.  Unfortunately the 
only way to test it is to compile the program.  Resizing the FLUID 
window is <I>not</I> the same as what will happen in the user program. </P>
<H3>Hotspot</H3>
 Each window may have exactly one hotspot (turning this on will turn 
off any others).  This will cause it to be positioned with that widget 
centered on the mouse.  This position is determined <I>when the FLUID 
function is called</I>, so you should call it immediately before showing 
the window.  If you want the window to hide and then reappear at a 
new position, you should have your program set the hotspot itself just 
before <tt>show()</tt>. 
<H3>Subclass</H3>
This is how you use your own subclasses of <tt>Fl_Widget</tt>.  Whatever 
identifier you type in here will be the class that is instantiated. 
<P>In addition, no <tt>#include</tt> header file is put in the <TT>.h</TT> file.  You 
must provide a <tt>#include</tt> line as the first line of the &quot;Extra
Code&quot; which declares your subclass. </P>
<P>The class must be similar to the class you are spoofing.  It 
does not have to be a subclass.  It is sometimes useful to change this 
to another FLTK class. Currently the only way to get a double-buffered 
window is to change this field for the window to &quot;Fl_Double_Window&quot; and 
to add &quot;#include &lt;FL/Fl_Double_Window.h&gt;&quot; to the extra code. </P>
<H3>Extra Code</H3>
These four fields let you type in literal lines of code to dump into 
the <TT>.h</TT> or <TT>.cxx</TT> files. 
<P>If the text starts with a <tt>#</tt> or the word <tt>extern</tt> then FLUID thinks 
this is an &quot;include&quot; line, and it is written to the <TT>.h</TT> file. If the 
same include line occurs several times then only one copy is written. </P>
<P>All other lines are &quot;code&quot; lines.  The current widget is 
pointed to by the local variable <tt>o</tt>.  The window being constructed is 
pointed to by the local variable <tt>w</tt>.  You can also access any 
arguments passed to the function here, and any named widgets that are 
before this one. </P>
<P>FLUID will check for matching parenthesis, braces, and quotes, but 
does not do much other error checking.  Be careful here, as it may be 
hard to figure out what widget is producing an error in the compiler. 
If you need more than four lines you probably should call a function in 
your own <TT>.cxx</TT> code. </P>
<H3>Callback</H3>
This can either be the name of a function, or a small snippet of code. 
If you enter anything but letters, numbers, and the underscore then FLUID
treats it as code. 
<P>A name names a function in your own code.  It must be declared as 
<tt>void name(&lt;class&gt;*,void*)</tt>. </P>
<P>A code snippet is inserted into a static function in the
<TT>.cxx</TT> output  file.  The function prototype is <tt>void
name(class *o, void *v)</tt> so that you can refer to the  widget as
<tt>o</tt> and the <tt>user_data()</tt> as <tt>v</tt>.  FLUID will
check for matching  parenthesis, braces, and quotes, but does not do
much other error  checking.  Be careful here, as it may be hard to
figure out what widget  is producing an error in the compiler. </P>
<P>If the callback is blank then no callback is set. </P>
<H3>user_data</H3>
This is a value for the <tt>user_data()</tt> of the widget.  If blank the 
default value of zero is used.  This can be any piece of C code that 
can be cast to a <tt>void</tt> pointer.
<H3>User Data Type</H3>
The <tt>void *</tt> in the callback function prototypes is replaced with this. 
You may want to use <tt>long</tt> for old XForms code.  Be warned that 
anything other than <tt>void *</tt> is not guaranteed to work! 
However on most architectures other pointer types are ok, and <tt>long</tt> is 
usually ok, too. 
<H3>When</H3>
When to do the callback.  This can be &quot;never&quot;, &quot;changed&quot;,
&quot;release&quot;, &quot;enter key&quot;, or &quot;no change&quot;.  The 
value of &quot;enter key&quot; is only useful for text input fields.  The &quot;no 
change&quot; button means the callback is done on the matching event even if 
the data is not changed. 
<P>There are other rare but useful values for the <tt>when()</tt> field that are 
not in the menu.  You should use the extra code fields to put these 
values in.</P>
<H2>Selecting and Moving Widgets</H2>
Double-clicking a window name in the browser will display it, if not 
displayed yet.  From this display you can select widgets, sets of 
widgets, and move or resize them.  To close a window either 
double-click it or type Esc.
<P>To select a widget, click it.  To select several widgets drag a 
rectangle around them.  Holding down shift will toggle the selection of 
the widgets instead. </P>
<P>You cannot pick hidden widgets.  You also cannot choose some widgets 
if they are completely overlapped by later widgets.  Use the browser to 
select these widgets. </P>
<P>The selected widgets are shown with a red &quot;overlay&quot; line around 
them.  You can move the widgets by dragging this box.  Or you can 
resize them by dragging the outer edges and corners.  Hold down the Alt 
key while dragging the mouse to defeat the snap-to-grid effect for fine 
positioning. </P>
<P>If there is a tab box displayed you can change which child is 
visible by clicking on the file tabs.  The child you pick is selected. </P>
<P>The arrow, tab, and shift+tab keys &quot;navigate&quot; the selection.  Left, 
right, tab, or shift+tab move to the next or previous widgets in the 
hierarchy.  Hit the right arrow enough and you will select every widget 
in the window.  Up/down widgets move to the previous/next widgets that 
overlap horizontally.  If the navigation does not seem to work you 
probably need to &quot;Sort&quot; the widgets.  This is important if you have 
input fields, as FLTK uses the same rules when using arrow keys to move 
between input fields. </P>
<P>To &quot;open&quot; a widget, double click it.  To open several widgets select 
them and then type F1 or pick &quot;Edit/Open&quot; off the pop-up menu. </P>
<P>Type Alt+o to temporarily toggle the overlay off without changing 
the selection, so you can see the widget borders. </P>
<P>You can resize the window by using the window manager border 
controls.  FLTK will attempt to round the window size to the nearest 
multiple of the grid size and makes it big enough to contain all the 
widgets (it does this using illegal X methods, so it is possible it 
will barf with some window managers!).  Notice that the actual window 
in your program may not be resizable, and if it is, the effect on child 
widgets may be different. </P>
<P>The panel for the window (which you get by double-clicking it) is 
almost identical to the panel for any other Fl_Widget.  There are three 
extra items: </P>
<H3>Border</H3>
 This button turns the window manager border on or off.  On most window 
managers you will have to close the window and reopen it to see the 
effect. 
<H3>xclass</H3>
 The string typed into here is passed to the X window manager as the 
class.  This can change the icon or window decorations.  On most (all?) 
window managers you will have to close the window and reopen it to see 
the effect.
<H2><A name=images>Image Labels</A></H2>
<P>Selecting &quot;Image...&quot; off the label style pull-down menu will bring 
up a file chooser from which you pick the image file.  If an image has 
already been chosen, you can change the image used by picking 
&quot;Image...&quot; again.  The name of the image will appear in the &quot;label&quot; 
field, but you can't edit it. </P>
<P>The <I>contents</I> of the image file are written to the <TT>.cxx</TT> file, 
so if you wish to distribute the C code, you only need to copy the <TT>.cxx</TT> 
file, not the images.  If many widgets share the same image then only 
one copy is written. </P>
<P>However the <I>file name</I> is stored in the <TT>.fl</TT> file, so to read 
the <TT>.fl</TT> file you need the image files as well.  Filenames are relative 
to the location the <TT>.fl</TT> file is (not necessarily the current 
directory).  I recommend you either put the images in the same 
directory as the <TT>.fl</TT> file, or use absolute path names. </P>
<H3>Notes for all image types</H3>
FLUID runs using the default visual of your X server.  This may be 8 
bits, which will give you dithered images.  You may get better results 
in your actual program by adding the code &quot;Fl::visual(FL_RGB)&quot; to your 
code right before the first window is displayed.
<P>All widgets with the same image on them share the same code and 
source X pixmap.  Thus once you have put an image on a widget, it is 
nearly free to put the same image on many other widgets. </P>
<P>If you are using a painting program to edit an image: the only way 
to convince FLUID to read the image file again is to remove the image 
from all widgets that are using it (including ones in closed windows), 
which will cause it to free its internal copy, and then set the image 
again.  You may find it easier to exit FLUID and run it again. </P>
<P>Don't rely on how FLTK crops images that are outside the widget, as 
this may change in future versions!  The cropping of inside labels will 
probably be unchanged. </P>
<P>To more accurately place images, make a new &quot;box&quot; widget and put the 
image in that as the label.  This is also how you can put both an image 
and text label on the same widget.  If your widget is a button, and you 
want the image inside it, you must change the button's boxtype to 
FL_UP_FRAME (or another frame), otherwise when it is pushed it will 
erase the image. </P>
<H3>XBM (X bitmap files)</H3>
FLUID will read X bitmap files.  These files have C source code to 
define a bitmap.  Sometimes they are stored with the &quot;.h&quot; or &quot;.bm&quot; 
extension rather than the standard &quot;.xbm&quot;.
<P>FLUID will output code to construct an Fl_Bitmap widget and use it 
to label the widget.  The '1' bits in the bitmap are drawn using the 
label color of the widget.  You can change the color in FLUID.  The '0' 
bits are transparent. </P>
<P>The program &quot;bitmap&quot; on the X distribution does an ok job of editing 
bitmaps. </P>
<H3>XPM (X pixmap files)</H3>
FLUID will read X pixmap files as used by the libxpm library. These 
files have C source code to define a pixmap.  The filenames usually 
have a &quot;.xpm&quot; extension.
<P>FLUID will output code to construct an Fl_Pixmap widget and use it 
to label the widget.  The label color of the widget is ignored, even 
for 2-color images that could be a bitmap. </P>
<P>XPM files can mark a single color as being transparent.  Currently 
FLTK and FLUID simulate this transparency rather badly.  It will use 
the color() of the widget as the background, and all widgets using the 
same pixmap are assummed to have the same color.  This may be fixed in 
the future or on non-X systems. </P>
<P>I have not found any good editors for small iconic pictures.  For 
pixmaps I have used <A href=http://www.danbbs.dk/~torsten/xpaint/index.html>
XPaint</A>.  This (and most other) painting programs are designed for 
large full color images and are difficult to use to edit an image of 
small size and few colors. </P>
<H3>GIF files</H3>
FLUID will also read GIF image files.  These files are often used on 
html documents to make icons.  This lets you use nice icons that you 
steal off the net in your user interface.
<P>FLUID converts these into (modified) XPM format and uses an 
Fl_Pixmap widget to label the widget.  Transparency is handled the same 
as for xpm files.  Notice that the conversion removes the compression, 
so the code may be much bigger than the .gif file.  Only the first 
image of an animated gif file is used. </P>
<P>Behavior and performance with large .gif files is not guaranteed! </P>
