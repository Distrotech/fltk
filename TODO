FLTK 2.0 TODO
------------- 	
	- Check & fix features Broken All Platform 
		(Surface,Image, Image  Manip, Fluid widget symbols handling, ...) 
	- Check & fix features Broken Mac Platform Only
	- Fix configure script and makefiles.
	- fltk::ValueInput buttons don't draw inactive.
	- Inactive widgets get engraved label type???
	- Selection in fltk::Input/InputBrowser is not drawn
	  inactive.
	  WAS: inactive widgets should not have focus so this
	  should not be a problem. However may be a problem for
	  Browser which shows selection even when it does not have focus.
	- FLUID widget panel has random widgets in red?
	  WAS: that is supposed to indicate which are set to
	  non-default values, but it may be broken.
	- Need to fix labels/etc. of widget panel.
	- Don't move checkers so slow.
