# FLTK toolkit configuration file

[default]
  # include mouse wheel configuration

  include wheel.conf

  # Which scheme should we use?  (Loads the themes too)
  # FLTK comes with:
  #   Alternative, Alt2, Classic, Essai, KDE, Motif, OldMotif, Windows

#  scheme = Alt2
  scheme = Alternative
#  scheme = Windows
#  scheme = KDE

# You can put a list of theme plugins here, but it's best to just use
# the schemes to load the themes
#  themes = KDE_colors
