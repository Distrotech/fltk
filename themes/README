This directory contains source code for fltk theme plugins.

"make" compiles these and places them in ../config/themes.  For fltk
programs to see these the contents of ../config must be copied to
~/.fltk (or /usr/local/lib/fltk), "make install" does this.

We really need some "themes" written that parse GTK, Enlightenment,
X resources, and other sources of theme information.
