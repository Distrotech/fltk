These are demonstrations of "themes" plugins for fltk.  To make them
work, type "make" and copy or link the binaries in this directory to
~/.fltk/themes.

To make one of these themes the default, add the line

  default theme = <theme>

to ~/.fltk/flconfig or link the theme to ~/.fltk/themes/default.

We really need some "themes" written that parse GTK, Enlightenment,
X resources, and other sources of theme information.

Makefile is probably Linux-specific.
