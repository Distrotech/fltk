This directory contains source code for fltk theme plugins.

"make" compiles these and places them in ../config/themes.  For fltk
programs to see these the contents of ../config must be copied to
~/.fltk (or /usr/local/lib/fltk), "make install" does this.

The files starting with "conf" are a INI/KDE resource file parser written
by Carl Everard Thompson, and are used by the KDE1 theme to read the
Kde resource files, and by Carl's own theme that allows text files to
control most aspects of all the styles in fltk.

We really need some "themes" written that parse GTK, Enlightenment,
X resources, and other sources of theme information.
