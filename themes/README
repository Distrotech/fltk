These are demonstrations of "themes" plugins for fltk.  To make them
work, type "make" and copy or link this directory to ~/.fltk/themes.

To make one of these themes the default, link it to
~/.fltk/themes/default.

The supplied code is really for demonstration purposes only!  Any real
themes would probably be much more complex.  We also really need some
"themes" written that parse KDE, Enlightenment, X resources, and other
sources of theme information.

Makefile is probably Linux-specific.
