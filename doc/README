This directory contains files used by the Doxygen documentation
generator to make fltk's documentation from comments in the source
code.

You need at least version 1.3.4 of Doxygen, available from

    http://www.doxygen.org/

To make the documentation, cd to this directory and type:

   doxygen

The resulting documentation will be in the html subdirectory. You
should also copy tiny.gif to that directory to put the fltk logo into
it.
