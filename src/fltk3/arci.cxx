  \brief Utility functions for drawing circles using integers
*/

// "integer" circle drawing functions.  These draw the limited
// circle types provided by X and NT graphics.  The advantage of
// these is that small ones draw quite nicely (probably due to stored
// hand-drawn bitmaps of small circles!) and may be implemented by
// hardware and thus are fast.

// Probably should add fltk3::chord.
