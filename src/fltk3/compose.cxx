/** Any text editing widget should call this for each fltk3::KEYBOARD event.
 Use of this function is very simple.
 
 <p>If <i>true</i> is returned, then it has modified the
 fltk3::event_text() and fltk3::event_length() to a set of <i>bytes</i> to
 insert (it may be of zero length!).  In will also set the "del"
 parameter to the number of <i>bytes</i> to the left of the cursor to
 delete, this is used to delete the results of the previous call to
 fltk3::compose().
 
 <p>If <i>false</i> is returned, the keys should be treated as function
 keys, and del is set to zero. You could insert the text anyways, if
 you don't know what else to do.
 
 <p>On the Mac OS platform, text input can involve marked text, that is, 
 temporary text replaced by other text during the input process. This occurs,
 e.g., when using dead keys or when entering CJK characters.
 Text editing widgets should preferentially signal
 marked text, usually underlining it. Widgets can call
 <tt>int fltk3::marked_text_length()</tt> <i>after</i> having called fltk3::compose(int&)
 to obtain the length in bytes of marked text that always finishes at the
 current insertion point. It's the widget's task to underline marked text.
 Widgets should also call <tt>void fltk3::reset_marked_text()</tt> when processing fltk3::UNFOCUS
 events. Optionally, widgets can also call
 <tt>void fltk3::insertion_point_location(int x, int y, int height)</tt> to indicate the window 
 coordinates of the bottom of the current insertion point and the line height. 
 This way, auxiliary windows that help choosing among alternative characters 
 appear just below the insertion point. If widgets don't do that, 
 auxiliary windows appear at the widget's bottom. The
 fltk3::Input and fltk3::TextEditor widgets underline marked text.
 If none of this is done by a user-defined text editing widget,
 text input will work, but will not signal to the user what text is marked.
 Finally, text editing widgets should call <tt>set_flag(MAC_USE_ACCENTS_MENU);</tt>
 in their constructor if they want to use the feature introduced with Mac OS 10.7 "Lion"
 where pressing and holding a key on the keyboard opens an accented-character menu window.
 
 <p>Though the current implementation returns immediately, future
 versions may take quite awhile, as they may pop up a window or do
 other user-interface things to allow characters to be selected.
