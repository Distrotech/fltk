currently, I slammed all FLTK source and header files into
fl. The fl directory should eventually contain only .di
files, but for now it is just simpler too keep the .d files
there.

For easy debugging, the Makefiel is located in root. Also
a silly thing to do, but it maked gdb sessions so much easier
until we have set up a nice IDE on all platforms (contibutions
very welcome!).

'test' contains the original C++ test files as they are ported.
Running "test/demo" will eventually show off all features that
are already ported.

No need to duplicate the C++ documentation here. Please download
that from fltk.org and eventually merge it into "D" style comments.

The "std" directory will contain all platform specific files, 
either the finished files already, or at least a script that 
will generate needed files from copyrighted C headers which
we can't redistribute. It is up to the user to get hold of
those C headers (which should generally be really easy).
