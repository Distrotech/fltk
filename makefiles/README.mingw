Mingw makefiles in this directory are OBSOLETE and are not longer maintained.

To compile FLTK using "mingw", you have to install also "msys" library from mingw
project. Assuming you have properly installed mingw and msys you can compile and
install FLTK from parent directory using standard Makefiles and configure script:

  sh configure --prefix=C:/FLTK
  make
  make install
