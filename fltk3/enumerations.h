    FLTK defines some constants to help the programmer to
    find out, for which FLTK version a program is compiled.
    
    The following constants are defined:
 */

/**
 * The major release version of this FLTK library.
   \sa FL_VERSION
 */
#define FL_MAJOR_VERSION	1

/**
 * The minor release version for this library.
 *
 * FLTK remains mostly source-code compatible between minor version changes.
 */
#define FL_MINOR_VERSION	3

/**
 * The patch version for this library.
 *
 * FLTK remains binary compatible between patches.
 */
#define FL_PATCH_VERSION	0

/**
 *  The FLTK version number as a \em double.
 *
 *  This is changed slightly from the beta versions
 *  because the old "const double" definition would not allow for conditional
 *  compilation...
 *
 *  FL_VERSION is a double that describes the major and minor version numbers.
 *  Version 1.1 is actually stored as 1.01 to allow for more than 9 minor
 *  releases.
 *
 *  The FL_MAJOR_VERSION, FL_MINOR_VERSION, and FL_PATCH_VERSION constants
 *  give the integral values for the major, minor, and patch releases
 *  respectively.
