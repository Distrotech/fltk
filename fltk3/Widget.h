    All "property" accessing methods, such as color(), parent(), or argument() 
    are implemented as trivial inline functions and thus are as fast and small

     \li 0: The callback is not done, but changed() is turned on.
     \li fltk3::WHEN_CHANGED: The callback is done each time the text is
         changed by the user.
     \li fltk3::WHEN_RELEASE: The callback will be done when this widget loses 
         the focus, including when the window is unmapped. This is a useful 
	 value for text fields in a panel where doing the callback on every
  	 change is wasteful. However the callback will also happen if the 
	 mouse is moved out of the window, which means it should not do 
	 anything visible (like pop up an error message).
	 You might do better setting this to zero, and scanning all the
	 items for changed() when the OK button on a panel is pressed.
     \li fltk3::WHEN_ENTER_KEY: If the user types the Enter key, the entire 
         text is selected, and the callback is done if the text has changed. 
	 Normally the Enter key will navigate to the next field (or insert 
	 a newline for a Fl_Multiline_Input) - this changes the behavior.
     \li fltk3::WHEN_ENTER_KEY|fltk3::WHEN_NOT_CHANGED: The Enter key will do the
         callback even if the text has not changed. Useful for command fields.
      fltk3::Widget::when() is a set of bitflags used by subclasses of 
      fltk3::Widget to decide when to do the callback.

      If the value is zero then the callback is never done. Other values 
      are described  in the individual widgets. This field is in the base 
      class so that you can scan a panel and do_callback() on all the ones
