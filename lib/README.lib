REAME.lib
---------

This README file is a placeholder for library files on your system. 
Under Microsoft Windows a successful build will contain both a debug
(fltkd.lib) and release (fltk.lib) library for you to link to.  Both
are built using the multi-threaded settings.  Currently the Visual C++
project files do not generate DLL libraries for FLTK.

Under UNIX a single library file (libfltk.a or libfltk.so) will be
built.
