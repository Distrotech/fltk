REAME.lib
---------

This README file is a placeholder for library files on your system. 
Under Microsoft Windows a successful build will contain debug
(fltkd.lib and fltkd.dll) and release (fltk.lib fltk.dll) libraries for
you to link to.  Both are built using the multi-threaded settings. 

Under UNIX a single library file (libfltk.a or libfltk.so) will be
built.
