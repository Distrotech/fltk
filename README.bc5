To build the FLTK toolkit using Borland C++ 5, you must first make sure that
you have applied all of the relevant patches available from Borland's web
site (www.borland.com).  FLTK will not compile without the patches.  For
BC5 version 5.0, you must at least update to 5.0B.

To compile the toolkit, open bc5/fltk.ide in Borland C++ and select "Build All"
from the "Project" menu.
