Fast Light Tool Kit (fltk) Version 0.99

----------------------------------------------------------------
How to build and install fltk:
----------------------------------------------------------------

See the file win32/README for information for Windoze95/NT.

1. Type "./configure", and then examine config.h and makeinclude.
1. Edit the file ./style.h to customize the appearance of fltk
3. Type "make", or (Linux and gcc only) type "make shared" to make
   a shared library.
4. For shared libraries, type "setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH $PWD/lib"
5. Test it by running "test/demo".

To install the new version of Fltk and fluid (this puts the library in
/usr/local/lib, the include files in /usr/local/include/FL, and fluid
into /usr/local/bin):

1. If you made the shared version, type "unsetenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH"
2. Type "su" and then your password
3. Type "make install"
4. If you made the shared version, type "/sbin/ldconfig"
5. Type ^D to get out of su.

On-line documentation:
----------------------------------------------------------------

All the documentation is in html in the subdirectory "documentation".
Use file:<here>/documentation/index.html to get started.  Install
should put the documentation in /usr/doc/fltk but this is not yet
implemented.

These files are readable without a browser:

Change log is in documentation/CHANGES
To Do list is in documentatoin/TODO.html

Get Mesa (necessary to run OpenGl on most Linux machines):
    http://www.ssec.wisc.edu/~brianp/Mesa.html

----------------------------------------------------------------
Window managers
----------------------------------------------------------------

Fltk now uses X transient windows for modal() windows.  This may
confuse some window managers.  Mostly it causes them to not put
any borders on the modal windows and prevent you from moving them.

For FVWM I recommend you put "DecorateTransients" into your .fvwmrc.

----------------------------------------------------------------
Mesa:
----------------------------------------------------------------

Currently the best way to get OpenGL on your Linux system is to use
Mesa.  Fltk has been tested with Mesa on several machines (and also
with "real" OpenGL on SGI machines).

Mesa is at:  http://www.ssec.wisc.edu/~brianp/Mesa.html

./configure will not see Mesa unless it is installed as either libGL
or libMesa.  If you don't want to do this you will have to edit
config.h (set HAVE_GL to 1) and makeinclude (add the libraries).

----------------------------------------------------------------
How to write programs that use Fltk:
----------------------------------------------------------------

The proper way to include Fltk header files is "#include <FL/Fl_xyz.H>".
If Fltk is installed this will work without switches.  If not you will
need to provide a -I switch pointing to this directory (all the
headers are in ./FL).

Linker switches will be something like "-lfltk -L/usr/X11R6/lib -lX11".
Some programs may require -lXext or -lm.  If Fltk is not installed you
will need to add a -L switch pointing at ./lib.

If you wish to distribute a program (in source form) that uses Fltk,
you are allowed by the license to directly include the portions of
Fltk that you need.  This may make it easier for a user to compile
your program since they don't need to install the library.  Please
provide instructions for the user on how they can get the entire
source of Fltk.

If you wish to distribute a compiled program without source code: this
is allowed.  See the license.
