---- Draft FLTK 1.1.5 Release Announcement ----

The FLTK Team is proud to announce the release of FLTK 1.1.5,
a cross-platform C++ GUI toolkit for UNIX(r)/Linux(r) (X11),
Microsoft(r) Windows(r), and MacOS(r) X. FLTK provides
modern GUI functionality without the bloat and supports 3D
graphics via OpenGL(r) and its built-in GLUT emulation.

The FLTK 1.1.5 release is primarily a bug-fix release including
documentation updates, fixes for 64-bit platforms, FLUID,
several widgets, and GLUT emulation, and fixes for several
platform-specific issues. The new release also adds project
files for Visual C++.NET and supports KDE 3.x icons.

FLTK is provided under the GNU Library Public License with
exceptions that allow for static linking.
