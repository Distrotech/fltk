---- Draft FLTK 1.1.4 Release Announcement ----

The FLTK Team is proud to announce the release of FLTK 1.1.4,
a cross-platform C++ GUI toolkit for UNIX(r)/Linux(r) (X11),
Microsoft(r) Windows(r), and MacOS(r) X. FLTK provides
modern GUI functionality without the bloat and supports 3D
graphics via OpenGL(r) and its built-in GLUT emulation.

The FLTK 1.1.4 release is primarily a bug-fix release including
fixes to FLUID and the Fl_File_Chooser, Fl_Help_View,
Fl_Text_Display, and Fl_Text_Editor widgets.  The new release
also adds a find method to Fl_Help_View.

FLTK is provided under the GNU Library Public License with
exceptions that allow for static linking.

Changes since FLTK 1.1.3 include:

	- The file chooser did not reset the click count when
	  changing directories; if you clicked on a file in the
	  same position after changing directories with a
	  double- click, the chooser treated it as a triple
	  click (STR #27)
	- Symbols with outlines did not get drawn inactive.
	- The Fl_Help_View widget now provides a find() method
	  to search for text within the page.
	- The Fl_Help_Dialog widget now provides a search box
	  for entering text to search for.
	- The default font encoding on OSX did not match the
	  default on WIN32 or X11.
	- Menu items were not drawn using the font specified in
	  the Fl_Menu_Item structure (STR #30)
	- Long menus that were aligned such that the top of an
	  item was exactly at the top of the screen would not
	  scroll (STR #33)
	- The OS issues appendix incorrectly stated that MacOS
	  8.6 and 9 were supported; they are not (STR #28)
	- Fixed handling of nested double-buffered windows (STR
	  #1)
	- Showing a subwindow inside a hidden window would crash
	  the application (STR #23)
	- OSX users couldn't enter some special chars when using
	  some foreign key layouts (STR #32)
	- Hiding subwindows on OSX would hide the parent window
	  (STR #22)
	- Added thin plastic box types.
	- Fl_Pack ignored the box() setting and cleared any
	  unused areas to the widget color; it now only does so
	  if the box() is set to something other than FL_NO_BOX.
	- Updated the Fl_Tabs widget to offset the first tab by
	  the box dx value to avoid visual errors.
	- Updated the plastic up box to draw only a single
	  border frame instead of the old double one for
	  improved appearance.
	- Updated the default background color on OSX to provide
	  better contrast.
	- Fl_Text_Display and friends now look for the next
	  non-punctuation/space character for word boundaries
	  (STR #26)
	- gl_font() didn't work properly for X11 when Xft was
	  used (STR #12)
	- Fl_File_Browser incorrectly included "." on WIN32 (STR
	  #9)
	- Include shellapi.h instead of ShellAPI.h in the WIN32
	  drag-n-drop code in order to work with the MingW cross
	  compiler (STR #6)
	- The cursor was not properly restored when doing
	  drag-n-drop on X11 (STR #4)
	- Fl::remove_fd() didn't recalculate the highest file
	  descriptor properly (STR #20)
	- Fl_Preferences::deleteGroup() didn't work properly
	  (STR #13)
	- Fixed the fl_show_file_selector() function - it was
	  copying using the wrong string size (STR #14)
	- fl_font() and fl_size() were not implemented on MacOS
	  X.
	- Sorted the icon menu bar in fluid.
	- Fixed minor memory access complaints from Valgrind
	- Compiling src/flstring.h on OS X with BSD header would
	  fail.
	- Fl_Text_Editor didn't scroll the buffer when the user
	  pressed Ctrl+End or Ctrl+Home.
	- Fl_Text_Editor didn't show its cursor when the mouse
	  was moved inside the window.
	- FLUID now uses an Fl_Text_Display widget for command
	  output, which allows you to copy and paste text from
	  command output into other windows.
	- Fl_Gl_Window could cause a bus error on MacOS X if the
	  parent window was not yet shown.
	- FLUID could crash after displaying a syntax error
	  dialog for the callback code.
	- FLUID would reset the callback code if you opened the
	  widget panel for multiple widgets.
	- Added a NULL check to Fl_Text_Display (SF Bug #706921).
	- The fltk-config script placed the LDFLAGS at the wrong
	  place in the linker options.
	- Fl_Text_Display didn't draw the outer box in the right
	  dimensions, so it was invisible.
	- Fl_Help_Dialog used the same color for links as for
	  the background, causing links to be invisible on pages
	  without a background color set.
