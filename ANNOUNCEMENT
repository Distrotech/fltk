<P>The FLTK Team is proud to announce the release of FLTK 1.1.3,
a cross-platform C++ GUI toolkit for UNIX&reg;/Linux&reg; (X11),
Microsoft&reg; Windows&reg;, and MacOS&reg; X. FLTK provides
modern GUI functionality without the bloat and supports 3D
graphics via OpenGL&reg; and its built-in GLUT emulation.

<P>The FLTK 1.1.3 release is primarily a bug-fix release
including several MacOS X drawing and OpenGL bugs. The new
release also adds support for up to 2 additional qualifiers
before a class name in FLUID.

<P>FLTK is provided under the GNU Library Public License with
exceptions that allow for static linking.

<P>Changes since FLTK 1.1.2 include:

<UL>

	<LI>Documentation updates.

	<LI>FLTK now ignores KeyRelease events when X11 sends them
	for repeating keys.

	<LI>FLUID now supports up to two additional qualifiers
	before a class name (FL_EXPORT, etc.) to aide in
	developing DLL interfaces for WIN32.

	<LI>Additional NULL checks in Fl_Button,
	fl_draw_boxtype(), Fl_File_Chooser, and
	Fl_Window::hotspot().

	<LI>The Fl_Preferences header file needed to FL_EXPORT all
	of the nested classes for WIN32.

	<LI>Fl_Double_Window couldn't be nested on WIN32. [SF Bug
	#658219]

	<LI>Fl_Slider didn't call the callback function when the
	user changed the value using the keyboard and the
	"when" condition was FL_WHEN_RELEASE. [SF Bug #647072]

	<LI>Lines with less than 2 unique vertices and polygons
	with less the 3 unique vertices were not drawn
	properly. [SF Bug #647067]

	<LI>The size_range() values were not honored under MacOS
	X. [SF Bug #647074]

	<LI>OpenGL windows didn't resize correctly on MacOS X.
	[SF Bug #667855]

	<LI>The menus incorrectly used the overlay visual when one
	or more menu items contained an image. [SF Bug #653846]

	<LI>Changed some error messages to use Fl::error() instead
	of fprintf()...

	<LI>Fl_Text_Buffer and Fl_Text_Display used free to free
	memory that was allocated using the new operator.

	<LI>Tweeked the plastic scheme under MacOSX to better
	match the colors.

	<LI>The Fl_Image.H always included the x.H header file,
	which included many system headers that could
	interfere with normal GUI applications.  It now uses
	the corresponding based types for the image id and
	mask to avoid this.

	<LI>The FLUID widget panel wasn't sorted, so keyboard
	navigation was strange. [SF Bug #647069]

	<LI>Fl_Scroll didn't compute the location of labels to the
	right or below when determining the area to erase.

	<LI>Added backward-compatibility macro for
	filename_setext().

	<LI>Fl_Bitmap::copy(), Fl_Pixmap::copy(), and
	Fl_RGB_Image::copy() all could overflow the source
	image when scaling the image.

	<LI>Double/triple clicks in Fl_Input fields didn't copy
	the expanded selection to the clipboard.

	<LI>Fl_Glut_Window and Fl_Gl_Window didn't always initialize
	the OpenGL context on MacOS.

</UL>
