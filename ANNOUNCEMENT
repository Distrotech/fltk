---- Draft FLTK 1.1.5 Release Announcement ----

The FLTK Team is proud to announce the release of FLTK 1.1.5,
a cross-platform C++ GUI toolkit for UNIX(r)/Linux(r) (X11),
Microsoft(r) Windows(r), and MacOS(r) X. FLTK provides
modern GUI functionality without the bloat and supports 3D
graphics via OpenGL(r) and its built-in GLUT emulation.

The FLTK 1.1.5 release is primarily a bug-fix release including
documentation updates, fixes for 64-bit platforms, FLUID,
several widgets, and GLUT emulation, and fixes for several
platform-specific issues. The new release also adds project
files for Visual C++.NET and supports KDE 3.x icons.

exceptions that allow for static linking.

	  localization of the file chooser's new directory
	  button (STR #340)

	- The Fl_Widget copy operator definitions were not
	  conditionally compiled properly (STR #329)
	- FLUID's Layout functionality did not move child
	  widgets when laying out group widgets (STR #319)
	- FLUID's Layout->Center In Group functionality did not
	  properly handle widgets that were children of a

	- The Fl_Text_Display destructor did not remove the
	  predelete callback associated with the current buffer
	  (STR #332)

	- fl_filename_relative() returned the wrong string if
	  the absolute pathname was equal to the current working
	  directory (STR #224)
	- Fl_Help_Dialog didn't correctly restore the scroll
	  position when going forward/back in the link history
	  if the file changed (STR #218)

	  confusing some GLUT-based applications (STR #213)

	  #229)
	- Fl_Sys_Menu_Bar is now built into the library for
	  MacOS X (STR #229)

	  would cause an application to lockup (STR #196)
	- Some of the widgets could crash an application if the
	  cursor was changed after a window was deleted (STR
	  #181)
	- The Fl_Gl_Window WIN32 pixel format code did not
	  choose the pixel format with the largest depth buffer
	  (STR #175)
	- The configure script didn't leave space between the

	  (STR #164)
	- Added new hoverdelay() to Fl_Tooltip to control how
	  quickly recent tooltips appear (STR #126)
