<h2>class fltk::Bitmap</h2>
<hr>

This subclass of <a href="Fl_Image.html"><tt>fltk::Image</tt></a>
encapsulates the width, height, and bits of an X bitmap (XBM), and
allows you to make an <TT>fltk::Widget</TT> use a bitmap as a label, or
to just draw the bitmap directly.

<h4>fltk::Bitmap(const char *bits, int W, int H)
<br>fltk::Bitmap(const unsigned char *bits, int W, int H)</h4>

Construct using an X bitmap.  The bits pointer is simply copied to the 
object, so it must point at persistent storage.  The two constructors 
are provided because various X implementations disagree about the type 
of bitmap data.  To use an XBM file use: 

<pre>#include &quot;foo.xbm&quot;
...
fltk::Bitmap bitmap = new fltk::Bitmap(foo_bits, foo_width, foo_height);
</pre>

<h4>~Bitmap()</h4>

The destructor will destroy any X pixmap created.  It does not do 
anything to the bits data. 

<h4>void draw(int x, int y, int w, int h, fltk::Flags = 0)</h4>

The image is drawn with the top-left corner at <i>x,y</i>. The
<i>w</i> and <i>h</i> are ignored.  1 bits are drawn with the current
color, 0 bits are unchanged. The flags are ignored
(<tt>fltk::INACTIVE</tt> can be done by selecting a gray version of the
color).

<h4>void draw(int x, int y, fltk::Flags = 0)</h4>

Draws the image with the upper-left corner at <tt>x,y</tt>.  This is 
the same as doing <tt>draw(x, y, this-&gt;w, this-&gt;h, flags)</tt>.
