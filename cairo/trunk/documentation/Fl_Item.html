<h3>Description</h3>

This widget is designed to be put into <a
href="Fl_Menu_.html">fltk::Menu</a> and <a
href="Fl_Browser.html">fltk::Browser</a> widgets.

<p>It's draw() method is designed to appear correctly inside menus and
browsers, despite inconsistencies in the designs of these things on
Windows. By default it does not erase it's background and assumes that
if <tt>fltk::SELECTED</tt> is set in the flags it should use the
selected_label_color(). You can change this by setting box() or the
colors in the style, or by overriding the draw() method, but if you do
so you will probably have to limit your widget to either menus or
browsers, but not both.

<p>The browser draws the focus dotted box and the hierarchy
indicators, and the shortcut key assigments in menus is drawn by the
menu code. You cannot turn these off or modify them, unfortunately I
was unable to get these into the child widgets and still replicate the
standard Windows UI appearance.

<p>Currently you can set <a href="Fl_Widget.html#type">type()</a> to
<tt>fltk::Item::TOGGLE</tt> to get a checkmark on the left and
<tt>fltk::Item::RADIO</tt> to make it a radio button. This may change in
future versions however and you may need to use a subclass for this.

<p>In a multi-browser, the <a href="Fl_Widget.html#selected">selected()</a>
indicates if the widget is currently selected.

<h3>Methods</h3>

<ul>
<li><a href=#Item>fltk::Item</a></li>
<li><a href=#~Item>~Item</a></li>
</ul>

<h4><a name=Item>fltk::Item::Item(const char * = 0)</a></h4>

Unlike other widgets the constructor does not take any dimensions,
since it is assummed the container widget will size this correctly.

<h4><a name="~Item">fltk::Item::~Item(void)</a></h4>
