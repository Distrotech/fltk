<h2>class fltk::StyleSet</h2>
<hr>

Fltk can manage "sets" of styles. This is useful for making a program
that displays more than one "theme" at a time, such as a program
that edits or creates themes. The "test" widgets can display the theme
under development, while the main widgets stay unchanged. Fluid uses
this to allow you to try your program under different themes.

<p>Each widget "belongs" to a set, which is assigned to the current
set when the widget is constructed.

<p>The actual implementation is to change the pointers such as
fltk::Widget::default_style for every widget class to point to a new
copy, so when the constructors for each widget are run they assign the
new copy. The previous copies are saved and restored if the older set
name is used.

<p>There are some problems. Many widgets are dynamically created (for
instance pop-up menus) and may not inherit the expected theme unless
you are careful. Also some global things such as the background color
cannot be seperated into sets.

<h4><a name=StyleSet>fltk::StyleSet::StyleSet()</a></h4>

The <i>first</i> fltk::StyleSet you create is made into the current one
and is made equal to the current settings of the styles. All other
style sets you create are set to a <a href=#revert>revert</a> form of
all the styles and  you must call <a
href=#make_current>make_current</a> on them to make them useful.

<h4><a name=~StyleSet>fltk::StyleSet::~StyleSet()</a></h4>

Currently this does nothing.

<h4><a name=make_current>void fltk::StyleSet::make_current();</a></h4>

<p>Make this set be current. All widgets created after this use this
set, and calling <a href=#reload_theme>fltk::Style::reload_theme()</a>
will change the styles belonging to tis set.
