 * FL_DEFAULT_STYLE:

 * The default style for applications; normally we default to the
 * Microsoft Windows style, which also looks a lot like GTK, Qt, etc.
 *
 * You can change this by defining FL_DEFAULT_STYLE to one of the
 * following:
 *
 *    FL_WINDOWS_STYLE  - A style that looks like Microsoft Windows
 *    FL_MOTIF_STYLE    - A style that looks like standard CDE/Motif
 *    FL_SGI_STYLE      - A style that looks like the SGI "Indigo Magic"
 *                        version of Motif.
 *
 * This really doesn't do anything yet except change sliders - CET

 * every system, with the newest versions of Irix having broken it
 * as well.  I think it is suffering from software rot, since nobody
 * uses it...  Reliable hardware double buffering can only be had by
