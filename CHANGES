CHANGES SINCE FLTK 1.0.1

    - Documentation updates
    - The Visual C++ project files didn't include fl_add_idle.cxx.
    - LIBRARY/DSO name inconsistencies in src/Makefile.
    - src/Makefile didn't clean the DSO.
    - The valuator demo now has only a single callback.
    - The code looked for HAVE_SYS_SELECT_H, but the
      config file uses HAVE_SYS_SELECT.
    - Fl_Image redraw not quite right under X11 or WIN32
    - Problems with timeouts & cube demo under WIN32
    - FLUID problems with inline functions.
    - Documentation fixes...
    - Fl_Browser::item_height() didn't handle blank lines or
      non-default fonts properly.
    - FL/math.h didn't have #ifndef...#define...#endif guards
      against multiple inclusion...
    - Fl_Menu_::copy() fix - didn't allocate power of 2...
    - Fl::damage() now remains true until all windows are actually
      redrawn.
    - Fl_Widget destructor, hide(), and deactivate() methods no longer
      send FL_LEAVE, FL_RELEASE, or FL_UNFOCUS events to the widget
      (which could cause applications to crash).
    - FLUID now outputs symbolic names for align() and when().
    - Fixed select() to use maxfd + 1 instead of maxfd.
    - Added "Fl::remove_fd(fd, when)" function so you can remove the
      read and write callbacks separately.
    - The Fl::add_fd() and Fl::add_timeout() arrays are now dynamically
      allocated.
    - FLUID didn't always turn the FL_SUBMENU flag on for submenu titles.
    - The "extra code" in FLUID now is placed before the "o->end()" call
      for Fl_Group and its derived classes.
    - You can now set a FL_Window widget's class in FLUID to Fl_Group to
      generate a function or class that builds part of a GUI (i.e. no window).
    - FLUID now displays "Save file before exiting?" with the standard yes,
      no, and cancel buttons rather than "Discard changes?".
    - Fl_Menu_::add() now works with any type of menu, even one set with
      the menu() method.
    - The keypad keys were not always decoded properly under X11.
    - Some pointers were not being turned off when widgets were deleted,
      which caused some applications (like FLWM) to crash.
