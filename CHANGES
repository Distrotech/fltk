CHANGES SINCE FLTK 1.0.3

    - Documentation updates
    - Fl_Browser::bottomline(size) didn't scroll to the bottom
      if the second-to-last line was visible.
    - fl_wait() didn't poll FDs properly for WIN32.
    - Fixed DLL definitions for BC++.
    - FLUID now handles nested classes properly.
    - The "connect" demo now does a wait() for the PPP process
      so that you aren't left with a lot of zombie processes.
    - Fixed the FLTK colormap to use FF instead of F4 for full
      intensity values.
    - Minor change to scrollbar drawing code to match other
      toolkits.
    - New selections would cancel themselves out in WIN32.
    - The header file links were broken in the IRIX
      distributions.
    - fl_elapsed() now always uses GetClockTick() for WIN32.
    - fl_display is now initialized to GetModuleHandle(NULL) -
      this fixes problems people had with Cygwin and MingW32.
    - WinMain() is no longer compiled in with Cygwin and
      MingW32; it wasn't being used for those compilers anyways.
    - Added Solaris compiler options to configure script.
    - Fl_Value_Input wouldn't update properly if you set the
      value from a callback.
    - Fl_Tile wouldn't resize if the resizeable widget was the
      last child.
    - Was missing #include <ctype.h> and #include <stdlib.h> in
      several files, which caused problems on some platforms.
    - Fixed another case where Fl_Browser_ could get in an
      infinite resizing loop.
    - Fl_win32.cxx now includes <FL/filename.H> to export missing
      DLL symbols.
    - Fluid didn't handle member functions that include the
      scope operator.
    - Fl_Chart was dividing by 0 if there were no data samples
      or if they were all the same (min == max).

CHANGES SINCE FLTK 1.0.2

    - XDBE is now enabled for IRIX 6.[234] as well as 6.5.
    - FLUID didn't write the when() condition properly.
    - Tab/space/backtab/backspace can be used to navigate
      through menus.
    - Changed $(DSONAME) in the src/Makefile to "libfltk.so.1
      libfltk.sl.1".
    - Fl_Browser could read past the end of the string when
      computing the item height.
    - Fl_Browser could get in an infinite loop when checking to
      see if scrollbars needed to be displayed.
    - FLUID now honors the return type of the outermost widget. 
      This was a problem when substituting Fl_Group in an
      Fl_Window widget.
    - Fl_Menu_::copy() wasn't allocating a power of 2 for the
      array size.
    - FLWM would crash if fl_xmousewin was deleted.
    - The fast_slow demo now uses output widgets.
    - Timers under WIN32 were unreliable.

CHANGES SINCE FLTK 1.0.1

    - Documentation updates
    - The Visual C++ project files didn't include fl_add_idle.cxx.
    - LIBRARY/DSO name inconsistencies in src/Makefile.
    - src/Makefile didn't clean the DSO.
    - The valuator demo now has only a single callback.
    - The code looked for HAVE_SYS_SELECT_H, but the
      config file uses HAVE_SYS_SELECT.
    - Fl_Image redraw not quite right under X11 or WIN32
    - Problems with timeouts & cube demo under WIN32
    - FLUID problems with inline functions.
    - Documentation fixes...
    - Fl_Browser::item_height() didn't handle blank lines or
      non-default fonts properly.
    - FL/math.h didn't have #ifndef...#define...#endif guards
      against multiple inclusion...
    - Fl_Menu_::copy() fix - didn't allocate power of 2...
    - Fl::damage() now remains true until all windows are actually
      redrawn.
    - Fl_Widget destructor, hide(), and deactivate() methods no longer
      send FL_LEAVE, FL_RELEASE, or FL_UNFOCUS events to the widget
      (which could cause applications to crash).
    - FLUID now outputs symbolic names for align() and when().
    - Fixed select() to use maxfd + 1 instead of maxfd.
    - Added "Fl::remove_fd(fd, when)" function so you can remove the
      read and write callbacks separately.
    - The Fl::add_fd() and Fl::add_timeout() arrays are now dynamically
      allocated.
    - FLUID didn't always turn the FL_SUBMENU flag on for submenu titles.
    - The "extra code" in FLUID now is placed before the "o->end()" call
      for Fl_Group and its derived classes.
    - You can now set a FL_Window widget's class in FLUID to Fl_Group to
      generate a function or class that builds part of a GUI (i.e. no window).
    - FLUID now displays "Save file before exiting?" with the standard yes,
      no, and cancel buttons rather than "Discard changes?".
    - Fl_Menu_::add() now works with any type of menu, even one set with
      the menu() method.
    - The keypad keys were not always decoded properly under X11.
    - Some pointers were not being turned off when widgets were deleted,
      which caused some applications (like FLWM) to crash.
