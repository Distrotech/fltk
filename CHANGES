CHANGES SINCE FLTK 1.0.7

	- Many documentation changes/fixes/improvements.
	- FLUID didn't save Fl_Double_Window's as
	  double-buffered windows.
	- Fl_Menu_ text color is used if Fl_Menu_Item text color
	  is not set.
	- Added Fl::first_window(window) method to change the
	  "top" window that is used when showing modal windows.
	  By default it is the window the user last
	  clicked/typed in.
	- The Fl_Menu::global() handler now uses the current top
	  window instead of the menu bar for modal stuff.
	- Added fl_line_style() function to set the line style. 
	  Note that user-defined line styles ONLY WORK UNDER X11
	  and Windows NT/2000. Windows 95/98 do, however,
	  support the "standard" line styles.
	- Fl::wait() does not return immediately when no windows
	- XForms keyboard shortcuts using hex keycode constants
	  now work.
	- Updated the configure script for *BSD and to turn off
	  exceptions and RTTI in the FLTK library itself (does
	  not affect applications which use these things)
	- FLUID now supports I18N using the POSIX or GNU
	  mechanisms.
	- Fixed definition of glutBitmapWidth to match header
	  file.
	- Does not turn visible() on when a window is iconized()
	  or if a modal window is shown and it's parent is
	  iconized.  This allows the code "while (w->visible()
	  && w->damage()) Fl::check();" to reliably wait for the
	  window to be mapped and drawn the first time.
	- Setting box(FL_NO_BOX) on a button makes it an
	  invisible overlay
	- FL_NORMAL_SIZE is now a global variable so you can
	  change the default text size prior to creating your
	  widgets.
	- Menus now draw properly with a box type of
	  FL_FLAT_BOX.
	- Cygwin fixes to compile in POSIX mode.
	- Fl_Value_Input callback can call value() or
	  destructor.
	- OpenGL overlays now work under Windows NT!
	- Fl_Slider and Fl_Scrollbar could cause a divide by
	  zero.
	- Clicking in an Fl_Input field no longer selects the
	  whole field, it just moves the text cursor.
	- Tru64 UNIX fixes for filename_list()
	- Fl_Browser now draws itself properly when deactivated.
	- FLUID GUIs now use Courier font for all code input.
	- The FLUID OK and Cancel buttons are now all shown in
	  the same order in all windows.
	- Fixes to compile under GCC 2.95.2
	- Fixed the BC5 project files.
	- FL_LEFT_MOUSE and friends are now in
	  <FL/Enumerations.H>
	- Fixes for fake OpenGL overlay code under WIN32.
	- Message windows are now resizeable.
	- On WIN32 non_modal (but not modal) windows have the
	  close and size boxes.
	- Fl_Button and friends didn't honor the
	  FL_WHEN_NOT_CHANGED condition.
	- Disabled XDBE on all platforms.
	- XGetDefault patch from James Roth
	- New fl_open_display(Display *) function to allow FLTK
	  to share a display connection with another toolkit
	  (like Xt, GTK, etc.)
	- Shortcut labels for special keys should now display
	  properly under WIN32.
	- fl_set_fonts() did not reuse fonts.
	- Fixed shortcut problem under WIN32 when the focus
	  window changes.
	- "dead" keys should now work under X11.
	- Fixes to make FLTK compile with GCC 2.95.2
	- FL_SHORTCUT fix for I18N.
	- Fixed cut/paste problems under WIN32
	- FLUID now produces correct code for nested class
	  destructors.
	- Nested windows should now redraw properly under WIN32.
	- "table" is now static in fl_cursor.cxx
	- Fl_Chart used the textcolor() and not the color() for
	  horizontal bar charts.
	- Now set the input hint for TWM and TWM-derived window
	  managers.
	- Now look for TrueColor visual if FLTK is compiled with
	  USE_COLORMAP == 0.
	- Fl_Scrollbar could generate a divide-by-0 error if the
	  min and max values were the same.
	- Fl_Menu_::remove() now removes whole submenus if
	  needed.
	- Scrollbar buttons now draw themselves pushed in as
	  needed.
	- Fixed the gl_overlay demo (and gl overlays in general)
	  when they are faked with no hardware and the window is
	  resized.
	- Selections weren't shown in Fl_Browser widgets when an
	  item used the @B (background) format.
	- Windows can now be resized by the program under X11
	  for more window managers.
	- OS/2 makeinclude updates.
	- Added Fl.H required by an inline function in
	  Fl_Repeat_Button.H
	- Fl_add_idle adds new functions to the end of the queue
	  ring, rather than the start, so they are executed in
	  the order added, and a callback that adds itself does
	  not prevent others from being called.
	- Fluid lets you type in code that starts with '#' for
	  cpp directives.
	- XBell() could be called before the X11 display was
	  opened, causing a segfault.
	- Fixed Fl_Gl_Window::ortho() - Borland C++ doesn't
	  define GLint to "int", but instead to "long"...
	- Fixed Fl_Browser scrollbars within an Fl_Scroll
	  widget.
	- Fl_Output (and non-focused Fl_Input) now scroll in
	  response to position()
	- Fl_Input now does not scroll horizontally if the
	  entire string will fit in the widget.
	- Fl_Scrollbar didn't push the right arrow buttons when
	  you clicked outside the scroller.
	- Now use WSAAsyncSelect() for better socket performance
	  with Fl::add_fd()


CHANGES SINCE FLTK 1.0.6

	- Fixed Fl_Input_ bug under WIN32 - no longer stop accepting input
	  when one of the "Windows" keys is pressed.
	- Now call TranslateEvent for all events under WIN32.
	- Fixes for OpenBSD and NetBSD
	- The FL_CURSOR_HAND cursor now uses the IDC_HAND cursor instead of
	  IDC_UPARROW under Windows 98 and 2000.
	- Fl_Scrollbar now does a page-up/down when you click outside the
	  scroller.
	- Fl_Window::show(0, NULL) causes core dump
	- Fixed a compile-time error in fl_call_main.c for Borland C++.
	- "fluid -c filename.fl" would try to open an X display if the
	  FLUID file contained an Fl_Browser widget.
	- Fl_Browser now correctly measures items with @C or @B color
	  formatting commands.
	- Fixed a bitmap drawing bug for WIN32 (bit reversal table was wrong)
	- fl_xyz() dialogs now set a title in the title bar.
	- fl_alert() sounds the bell under X11.
	- fl_xyz() dialogs now call MessageBeep() under WIN32.
	- Fl_Browser_ didn't draw the selection box with the inactive color
	  when the browser wasn't activated.
	- Fl_Browser now responds to FL_KEYBOARD as well as FL_SHORTCUT.  If
	  you subclass it to accept focus then keyboard navigation will work.
	- Fl_Tile and Fl_Tabs do their callback when the user changes their
	  display.
	- Made some of the private methods of Fl_Browser protected.
	- Now set win_gravity correctly, this helps some X
	  window managers that use it position the window where
	  FLTK wants it to be.
	- 0-width browsers crashed.
	- Minor change: if the X window manager does not do
	  anything else with windows that don't have their
	  position specified, the windows appear centered in the
	  screen, rather than in the top-left corner.  This
	  happened with modal windows under Irix 4Dwm.  This
	  also causes windows to be centered when no window
	  manager is running, which might be useful for
	  installation gui programs?
	- Clicking in an Fl_Input field the first time selects the entire
	  field.
	- Clicking the middle mouse button in an Fl_Input field now inserts
	  the text at the indicated position instead of the cursor position.
	- Drag-selecting text in an Fl_Input field now copies the text
	  automatically.
	- Fl::flush() no longer calls the draw() method for invisible windows.
	- Calling deactivate() on an invisible widget could cause an
	  infinite loop in some obscure cases.
	- Added #pragma's for SGI C++ compilers - the 6.{23} X headers had
	  errors in them.
	- Fl_Gl_Window::ortho() changed so that text and images
	  are not erased if the origin is off the left/bottom of the
	  window.
	- Small change to Fl_Input so that a click that gives it
	  the focus also selects all the text.
	- Fixed a slider drawing problem.
	- You can now add/delete children of Fl_Tabs widgets whether or
	  not they are visible.
	- Now embed woff options for SGI C++ compilers (gets rid of X11
	  header warnings)
	- draw_pixmap used a cast that the Digital UNIX C++ compiler didn't
	  like.
	- The GLUT function key constants were off by one.
	- The XPM reading code didn't handle RGB colors other than #rrggbb.


CHANGES SINCE FLTK 1.0.5

    - Fl_win32.cxx defined WM_MOUSE_LEAVE instead of WM_MOUSELEAVE.
    - Fl_get_key_win32.cxx needed to include <ctype.h>
    - gl_draw_pixmap.cxx needed a pointer cast for ANSI C++.
    - Fl_Repeat_Button didn't always delete its timeout.
    - Now keep track of the current OpenGL context; this provides
      significant performance improvements for OpenGL applications
      with a single context.


CHANGES SINCE FLTK 1.0.4

    - Fl_Roller didn't handle a width and height of 0.
    - filename_list() fix for FreeBSD.
    - Fixed RPM install docos - needed "--install" option...
    - Fl_Browser_ wouldn't draw the vertical scrollbar right away if it
      added a horizontal one which covered the last line.
    - Fl_Tabs problems - single-character labels don't show up (problem in
      measure_tabs() or measure_label() methods?), and doesn't clear top
      tab area before drawing tabs.
    - Fl_Browser needs a destructor.
    - fl_draw_label() quoted characters between 0x80 and 0xa0, which
      caused problems for some programs using the WinANSI character set.
    - FLUID didn't handle declared class destructors.
    - Fixed another WIN32 cut/paste bug.
    - Fl_Tabs didn't work properly when there was only 1 tab.
    - Fl_Menu::add() didn't delete the old array.
    - Fl_Repeat_Button didn't delete its timeout when disabled.
    - fl_draw() would crash if no font was set (now defaults to
      a 14-pixel Helvetica font)
    - Can't forward declare classes; need to check for "class ", "struct ",
      "union ", etc.  See Bill's message
    - Added #pragma around xlib.h for IRIX
    - FL_KEYBOARD events have the correct x/y when sent to child X
      windows. Note that if you worked around this bug by adjusting the
      x/y yourself you will have to change your code. In addition all
      events have the correct x/y when sent to the grab() widget.  And
      the code to do all this was simplified a lot.
    - The XPM code didn't handle named colors with spaces in the names.
    - Pressing ESCape closed the window with pointer focus, even if there
      was a modal window open (now closes the modal window).
    - Fluid no longer produces trigraphs accidentally in the image data.
    - Fluid uses string constant concatenation to produce shorter image
      data.
    - The Fl_Group deletion code crashed if there was exactly one child
      widget.
    - Simulated overlays in single-buffered Fl_Gl_Windows now draw
      correctly (though very slowly as it requires the entire window to
      be redrawn to erase the overlay).  This fix ported our Digital
      Domain programs better to systems with no overlay hardware.
    - Added support for extern "C" declarations in FLUID.
    - Added Fl_Pack support to FLUID.
    - Fixed the order of #include's in FLUID generated header files.
    - Fixed detection of vsnprintf and snprintf under HP-UX 10.20 once
      and for all.
    - The checkers demo did not compile with GCC 2.95
    - FLUID didn't output virtual destructors properly.
    - Added inline "make_visible()" method to Fl_Browser.
    - Fl::wait() now returns immediately if any timeouts are
      called.
    - 16-bit XPM files are now properly handled.
    - Fl_Window::resize() was missing FL_EXPORT (caused problems
      with Windows DLLs)
    - FLUID was writing extern declarations twice.
    - New FLUID arrow key functionality: arrows move by one pixel, shift+arrow
      resizes, ctrl+arrow steps by grid


CHANGES SINCE FLTK 1.0.3

    - Documentation updates
    - Fl_Browser::bottomline(size) didn't scroll to the bottom
      if the second-to-last line was visible.
    - fl_wait() didn't poll FDs properly for WIN32.
    - Fixed DLL definitions for BC++.
    - FLUID now handles nested classes properly.
    - The "connect" demo now does a wait() for the PPP process
      so that you aren't left with a lot of zombie processes.
    - Fixed the FLTK colormap to use FF instead of F4 for full
      intensity values.
    - Minor change to scrollbar drawing code to match other
      toolkits.
    - New selections would cancel themselves out in WIN32.
    - The header file links were broken in the IRIX
      distributions.
    - fl_elapsed() now always uses GetClockTick() for WIN32.
    - fl_display is now initialized to GetModuleHandle(NULL) -
      this fixes problems people had with Cygwin and MingW32.
    - WinMain() is no longer compiled in with Cygwin and
      MingW32; it wasn't being used for those compilers anyways.
    - Added Solaris compiler options to configure script.
    - Fl_Value_Input wouldn't update properly if you set the
      value from a callback.
    - Fl_Tile wouldn't resize if the resizeable widget was the
      last child.
    - Was missing #include <ctype.h> and #include <stdlib.h> in
      several files, which caused problems on some platforms.
    - Fixed another case where Fl_Browser_ could get in an
      infinite resizing loop.
    - Fl_win32.cxx now includes <FL/filename.H> to export missing
      DLL symbols.
    - Fluid didn't handle member functions that include the
      scope operator.
    - Fl_Chart was dividing by 0 if there were no data samples
      or if they were all the same (min == max).


CHANGES SINCE FLTK 1.0.2

    - XDBE is now enabled for IRIX 6.[234] as well as 6.5.
    - FLUID didn't write the when() condition properly.
    - Tab/space/backtab/backspace can be used to navigate
      through menus.
    - Changed $(DSONAME) in the src/Makefile to "libfltk.so.1
      libfltk.sl.1".
    - Fl_Browser could read past the end of the string when
      computing the item height.
    - Fl_Browser could get in an infinite loop when checking to
      see if scrollbars needed to be displayed.
    - FLUID now honors the return type of the outermost widget. 
      This was a problem when substituting Fl_Group in an
      Fl_Window widget.
    - Fl_Menu_::copy() wasn't allocating a power of 2 for the
      array size.
    - FLWM would crash if fl_xmousewin was deleted.
    - The fast_slow demo now uses output widgets.
    - Timers under WIN32 were unreliable.


CHANGES SINCE FLTK 1.0.1

    - Documentation updates
    - The Visual C++ project files didn't include fl_add_idle.cxx.
    - LIBRARY/DSO name inconsistencies in src/Makefile.
    - src/Makefile didn't clean the DSO.
    - The valuator demo now has only a single callback.
    - The code looked for HAVE_SYS_SELECT_H, but the
      config file uses HAVE_SYS_SELECT.
    - Fl_Image redraw not quite right under X11 or WIN32
    - Problems with timeouts & cube demo under WIN32
    - FLUID problems with inline functions.
    - Documentation fixes...
    - Fl_Browser::item_height() didn't handle blank lines or
      non-default fonts properly.
    - FL/math.h didn't have #ifndef...#define...#endif guards
      against multiple inclusion...
    - Fl_Menu_::copy() fix - didn't allocate power of 2...
    - Fl::damage() now remains true until all windows are actually
      redrawn.
    - Fl_Widget destructor, hide(), and deactivate() methods no longer
      send FL_LEAVE, FL_RELEASE, or FL_UNFOCUS events to the widget
      (which could cause applications to crash).
    - FLUID now outputs symbolic names for align() and when().
    - Fixed select() to use maxfd + 1 instead of maxfd.
    - Added "Fl::remove_fd(fd, when)" function so you can remove the
      read and write callbacks separately.
    - The Fl::add_fd() and Fl::add_timeout() arrays are now dynamically
      allocated.
    - FLUID didn't always turn the FL_SUBMENU flag on for submenu titles.
    - The "extra code" in FLUID now is placed before the "o->end()" call
      for Fl_Group and its derived classes.
    - You can now set a FL_Window widget's class in FLUID to Fl_Group to
      generate a function or class that builds part of a GUI (i.e. no window).
    - FLUID now displays "Save file before exiting?" with the standard yes,
      no, and cancel buttons rather than "Discard changes?".
    - Fl_Menu_::add() now works with any type of menu, even one set with
      the menu() method.
    - The keypad keys were not always decoded properly under X11.
    - Some pointers were not being turned off when widgets were deleted,
      which caused some applications (like FLWM) to crash.


CHANGES SINCE FLTK 1.0

    - Documentation fixes.
    - Fl::check() didn't return the correct value, breaking a number
      of applications.
    - Fixed fluid bug that caused styles patch to crash when you delete
      a menu item.
    - Updated valuators demo to put the values in the gui box.
    - Fl_Browser_::item_height() didn't always compute the correct
      value.
    - Fixed the alignment of Fl_Choice text.
    - Fixes for OS/2.

    - Fl::add_timeout() didn't work under WIN32 with small values.
    - The configure script and makefiles now define DSONAME and
      use the static library for all example programs.
